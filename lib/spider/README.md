# Spider

Attempt at solving the [Spider](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider) challenge.

## Dataset

To use our scripts, first download the Spider dataset from their
[main page](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider) (click on "Spider Dataset"). This will download a
file `spider.zip`, that you can unzip, resulting in a `spider` directory. To use it locally, move
this to `./data/`, or to use it on a remote machine, transfer it with `scp` for instance with:
`scp -r spider <user>@<ip>:<path/to/open-nlp>/lib/spider/data`

## How to run

all the scripts can be run using makefile. See the Makefile for more details.
