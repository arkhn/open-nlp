Her husband states that the patient started noticing foul smelling urine and lethargy on Friday (3 days prior to admission). She called her primary care physician's office and had a urinalysis and urine culture done at an outside clinic--she did not start any antibiotics at that time. She had no symptoms of urinary tract infection as she straight catheterizes every 4 hours and has no sensation in the area at baseline. Lethargy and productive cough worsened over the weekend until late last night when the patient produced dark sputum and had an oxygen saturation of 82% at home.\n\nSince her motor vehicle accident in 2018, she has been hospitalized 15 times, almost all of these admissions have been for urinary tract infection/pneumonia and many of them have involved medical intensive care unit stays. She was most recently discharged from City Hospital in October 2020; she was admitted for pneumonia and urinary tract infection, underwent a prolonged intubation and tracheostomy, and had a pulseless electrical activity arrest.\n\nIn the emergency department, initial vital signs: 98.1Â°F, heart rate 102, blood pressure 84/49, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 80% on room air. She was placed on non-rebreather and given 2 liters of normal saline with little effect on her blood pressure. Right internal jugular central venous line was placed in the emergency department and the patient was started on levophed. The patient was noted to be increasingly lethargic, blood gas notable for hypercapnea and acidosis (pH 7.14, pCO2 84, pO2 151). She was intubated in the emergency department. In total, she received 7 liters of normal saline, levophed, nebulizers, zosyn, vancomycin, fentanyl/versed prior to transfer to the medical intensive care unit.\n\nOn arrival to the medical intensive care unit, blood pressure was 150/90 on arterial line with heart rate in the 80s-90s. Levophed was weaned quickly. Initial central venous pressure was 11-13 and chest X-ray was notable for pulmonary vascular congestion with possible focal areas of infiltrate in the left upper lobe and right middle lobe.\n\nReview of prior microbiology data revealed that during her most recent hospitalization in June 2021, her sputum grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella and MRSA. In June 2021, her urine had grown resistant Klebsiella. Urinalysis and urine culture were obtained from the outside clinic where she had sent urine on Friday; this showed Citrobacter freundii resistant to cefazolin and fluoroquinolones, and sensitive to imipenem but with only minimum inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 4.\n\nReview of systems: Patient unable to answer, but per her husband, she had experienced some shoulder and neck aching, no subjective fevers at home, no focal weakness.
