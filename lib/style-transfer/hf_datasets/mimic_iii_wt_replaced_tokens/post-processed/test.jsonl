The EKG on the second day of hospitalization demonstrated ST elevations in lateral leads, which were more pronounced than on admission.

The patient had multiple episodes of coffee ground emesis. Nasogastric tube placement was attempted several times without success. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation continued.
