The patient is now tachycardic and febrile, in contrast to the bradycardia (HR 51 bpm) and normothermia (36.4 °C) recorded in Document 1 on 2114‑07‑23.\n   with diabetic ketoacidosis. It was reported by Ms. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 63**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1447**] (the\n   caseworker for pt's son), that Mr. [**Known lastname 1448**] found his wife on the\n   bathroom floor between 1-2:00 AM; he thought she was sleeping. He and\n   their son, [**Name (NI) 488**], went on their paper route. Apparently, late\n   afternoon/early evening, a customer asked about the pt's whereabouts\n   and was apparently told that she was sleeping on the bathroom floor.\n   This customer called the police who arrived at the [**Known lastname 1448**] [**Last Name (un) 1470**]\n   around 7:00 PM. The police also contact[**Name (NI) **] the husband of the pt's sis,\n   Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 1466**], and informed him of what had transpired. Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 1466**]\n   reported that her sister had been weak and thirsty [**Name (NI) 1117**] (08.24) and\n   that Monday she could not get out of bed. She said that the pt's\n   husband has [**Name (NI) 1471**] and that their son has severe autism. Mr.\n   [**Known lastname 1448**] is \"good at routine\" activities but has very poor judgment. It\n   is as though her sister, she said, is \"living with two children...and\n   is not taking care of herself.\" Apparently, [**Doctor First Name 488**] is a [**Hospital1 **] of the\n   state of CT, where the family had lived until five years ago. She and\n   her husband are\nstandby guardians\n of both [**Name (NI) 488**] and [**Name (NI) 1045**] if her\n   sister is unable to provide care. (It is unknown if there is any\n   documentation of this status.) Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 1447**] is feeling that it will not be\n   possible to place [**Doctor First Name 1045**] and [**Doctor First Name 488**] together; she is going to try to\n   place [**Doctor First Name 488**] in a group home. She said that Mr. [**Known lastname 1448**] could possibly\n   get an apartment, but she is not sure that will be possible because of\n   their indebtedness. The family apparently moved to [**Location (un) 1479**] when\n   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1045**]\n[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1506**] died leaving him enough money to purchase [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1470**],\n   which Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 1447**] says has a value most likely in the $200K range. At a\n   later point in time, the couple appeared to have gotten a second\n   mortgage on the house for $300K. She does not know how they\n   accomplished getting this loan, why they borrowed the money or why it\n   was given to them. Additionally, she said that she does not know on\n   what the family spent the money. Approximately two years ago they filed\n   for bankruptcy. There is a lawyer who has been trying to pay their\n   bills. The family income is approximately $4,500/month: SSDI, a small\n   pension, $1,600 from the paper route, and some financial assistance\n   that the family receives for [**Doctor First Name 488**]. Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 1447**] said that when the\n   family\ns clothes become dirty, that they drop them on the floor and\n   then go buy new ones. Currently, the bank is foreclosing on the house;\n   the family will be homeless in two months. Most likely, the car will be\n   repossessed, which obviously puts their ability to deliver papers in\n   danger. She found their [**Last Name (un) 1470**] to be quite filthy and that was after the\n   pt\ns brother had done some preliminary cleaning. [**Doctor First Name 488**], who has\n   difficulty managing his ADLs, is on a special diet. It is also\n   suspected that he physically abuses both [**Doctor First Name 1506**] based on bruises and\n   scratches on their bodies.\n   ADDENDUM:\n   Later in the afternoon, a Mr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1480**], a caseworker for DMR,\n   brought [**Doctor First Name 1045**] and [**Doctor First Name 488**] to hospital to see Ms. [**Known lastname 1448**]. In talking\n   with them, there is little sense that they have an understanding of how\n   critically ill the pt is, particularly [**Doctor First Name 488**], who is basically\n   nonverbal. What talking with Mr. [**Known lastname 1448**], he would become focused on\n   minutiae, such as how many NYT he delivers.\n    Communication with Team:\n   Primary Nurse: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 261**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1507**]\n   Case Manager: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 458**] [**Doctor Last Name 459**]\n   Plan / Follow up:\n   1.       A plan was made with Mr. [**Known lastname 1448**] and the case manager, Mr.\n   [**Name14 (STitle) 1480**], that he will be the go-between re arranging visits, as there is\n   a concern about [**Doctor First Name 1045**]\ns ability to drive safely to [**Location (un) 23**]. When the\n   family wants to come to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**], they will contact Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 1480**], who in\n   turn will call and speak with Ms. [**Known lastname 1448**]\ns nurse.\n   2.
