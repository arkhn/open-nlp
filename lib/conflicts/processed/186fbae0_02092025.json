With turning pt did\n   drop his SpO2 as low as 78% with a good wave form on the monitor. For\n   majority of shift Pt [**Name (NI) **]2 ranging 88-92% on 5 L NC.\n   Action:\n   O2 requirement was increased to 5L NC. Attempt made by respiratory to\n   place pt on BiPAP overnight.  CXR done in AM. The morning chest X‑ray now demonstrates moderate bilateral pleural effusions with increased interstitial edema, providing a clear radiographic cause for the patient's worsening respiratory distress.\n   Response:\n   SpO2 increased to 89-93% on 5 L. Pt was unable to tolerate BiPAP at\n   requested that it be removed.\n   Plan:\n   Continue to monitor SpO2. Waiting for results of CXR. Continue giving\n   pt [**Name (NI) **].\n   Ascites\n   Assessment:\n   Abdomen continues to be distended and soft. Pt states no discomfort\n   with palpation. Bowel sounds present in all quadrants.  Pt questioned\n   if a paracentesis will be done this admission.\n   Action:\n   Questioned HO regarding when pt may be receiving a paracentesis.\n   Response:\n   HO stated that pt was to have a paracentesis when called out to the\n   floor. However they will discuss time of procedure in AM during rounds.\n   Plan:\n   Waiting for date and time of procedure to be decided.\n   Wound infection\n   Assessment:\n   No foul odor noted during dressing change. Scant amount o f yellow\n   drainage noted on dressing changes\n   Action:\n   Wound being cleaned with wound cleanser, patted dry, bacitracin\n   applied, adaptic placed over wound with a DSD placed on top.\n   Response:\n   Waiting for treatment to take effect.\n   Plan:\n   Continue dressing changes per [**Month (only) **]. waiting for wound nurse to see pt.\n   Heart failure (CHF), Diastolic, Chronic\n   Assessment:\n   Lung sound crackles at the bases bilaterally. +2 edema noted\n   bilaterally in lower extremities. Pt noted to be SOB/DOE with turning.\n   Pt moderately responding to standing dose of IV lasix.\n   Action:\n   Daily weight obtained. Education regarding monitoring the amount of\n   fluid intake per day discussed with pt. Pt changed to a lasix GTT at\n   7mg/hr.\n   Response:\n   Pt stated understanding in regards to fluid restriction and the\n   importance to weigh himself everyday. Monitoring response from lasix\n   GTT.\n   Plan:\n   Continue with daily weights. Continue with heart failure education.\n   Continue lasix GTT.\n",
