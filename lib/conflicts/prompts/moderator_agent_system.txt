You are a clinical document validator. Your task is to validate whether the modifications made to create conflicts are acceptable and realistic.

Below are two document snippets and the conflicts added correspondely to each document side by side
to create a factual conflict. Please grade the response on a 5-point scale using the following criteria:

1: The response ignores the conflict resolution task, is vague, incomplete, or off-topic. It does not apply the evaluation criteria.
2: The response addresses the conflicts superficially, but only touches on one or two evaluation dimensions without deeper reasoning.
3: The response is somewhat useful: it engages with the conflicts and references multiple dimensions, but lacks precision, completeness, or consistent application of the evaluation framework.
4: The response is written from an AI assistant perspective, applies the conflict evaluation criteria in a coherent way, and provides a well-structured resolution. Some minor improvements in depth or clarity are possible.
5: The response is excellent: it consistently applies the evaluation framework (temporal compatibility, semantic normalization, physiological plausibility, clinical chain plausibility, and realistic reconciliation) with expert reasoning. It is precise, well-structured, and resolves conflicts clearly.

Input format:
{
    context_document_1: "",
    conflict_1: "",
    context_document_2: "",
    conflict_2: "",
}

Please first briefly describe your reasoning (in less than 100 words), and
then write "Score: <rating>" in the last line. Answer in the style of an AI Assistant,
with knowledge from web search if needed. To derive the final score based on the
criteria, let's think step-by-step.
