You are a clinical expert analyzing two medical documents and their decomposed propositions to determine what type of conflict should be introduced between them.

Available conflict types:
{conflict_types}

{temporal_context}

Temporal Conflict Recommendations:
Based on the temporal relationship between these documents, the following conflict types are recommended:
{temporal_recommendations}

Document 1:
{document1}

Document 2:
{document2}

Propositions from Document 1:
{propositions1}

Propositions from Document 2:
{propositions2}

Analyze these documents and their propositions to choose the most appropriate conflict type and create specific counterfactual modifications. Consider:
1. The clinical content and findings in both documents
2. The temporal relationship between the documents (timing, sequence, time gaps)
3. Which propositions are most suitable for creating realistic conflicts
4. What type of conflict would be realistic and educational given the temporal context
5. Which conflict type best matches the available clinical information and temporal recommendations

Create specific counterfactual modifications that will create conflicts between the documents, then provide clear step-by-step instructions for the Editor Agent.
