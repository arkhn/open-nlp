You are a clinical expert analyzing two medical documents to determine what type of conflict should be introduced between them.

Available conflict types:
{conflict_types}

{temporal_context}

Temporal Conflict Recommendations:
Based on the temporal relationship between these documents, the following conflict types are recommended:
{temporal_recommendations}

Document 1:
{document1}

Document 2:
{document2}

Analyze these documents and choose the most appropriate conflict type to introduce. Consider:
1. The clinical content and findings in both documents
2. The temporal relationship between the documents (timing, sequence, time gaps)
3. What type of conflict would be realistic and educational given the temporal context
4. Which conflict type best matches the available clinical information and temporal recommendations

Respond with JSON format:
{{
    "conflict_type": "chosen_conflict_type_key",
    "reasoning": "explanation of why this conflict type was chosen, including temporal considerations",
    "modification_instructions": "specific instructions for the Editor Agent on how to create the conflict"
}}
