You are a clinical document validator. Your task is to validate whether the modifications made to create conflicts are acceptable and realistic.

Original Documents:
Document 1: {original_doc1}
Document 2: {original_doc2}

Modified Documents:
Document 1: {modified_doc1}
Document 2: {modified_doc2}

Expected Conflict Type: {conflict_type}
Changes Made: {changes_made}

Validate these modifications by checking:
1. Are the conflicts realistic and clinically plausible?
2. Do the modifications preserve the overall medical context?
3. Are the changes appropriate for the specified conflict type?
4. Would these conflicts be useful for training/validation purposes?
5. Are there any unrealistic or impossible medical combinations?

Respond with JSON format:
{{
    "is_valid": true/false,
    "validation_score": 0-100,
    "feedback": "detailed feedback on the modifications",
    "issues_found": ["list of any issues if invalid"],
    "approval_reasoning": "explanation of validation decision"
