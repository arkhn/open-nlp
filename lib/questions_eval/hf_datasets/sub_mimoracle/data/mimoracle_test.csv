Chief Complaint:
Melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 62 yo female with PMH CAD, MVR (on coumadin),
AAA, COPD, anemia presents with GIB.

Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] last week for cardiac cath for
work up of recent DOE/SOB and increasing chest pain over the
past month. Cardiac cath revealed no changed - she had patent
RCA stents and LIMA to LAD. Pt was put on heparin bridge and
restarted on coumadin prior to discharge. Pt states that she saw
her PCP 3 days PTA (monday) to have her [**Hospital1 263**] checked, which was
3.2. On the day prior to admission, pt developed worsening
fatigue, weakness, and lightheadedness. She had a brief episode
of chest discomfort at rest, which she describes as a pressure
like feeling. That evening, pt had an episode of bloody
diarrhea, which she describes as black stool w/dark red blood
mixed in. Pt denies any prior hx of GIB. Pt denies hematemesis,
coffee ground emesis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  Denies
recent NSAID use, other that daily baby [**Hospital1 **]; denies steroid use.
Pt had no further episodes of bloody stools that evening. She
presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital the following morning. She
states she was given Vitamin K there and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].

In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was given 2U FFP, 2U PRBC. 3 large bore IVs were
placed. NG lavage was negative. Pt was seen by GI, who may
consider EGD in AM. EKG was noted to have ST depressions in the
lateral leads. She underwent colonoscopy  - were able to reach
the ascending colon - no obvious source of bleed. Patient has
been transfused a total of 7 U PRBCs since admission on [**5-9**]. No
further bloody bowel movements or melena during admission.
Ontransfer from unit to floor, pt denied CP, SOB, states
weakness/fatigue is improved.

GI studies:
EGD ([**2145**]): Erythema, congestion and edematous folds in the
stomach body and fundus compatible with gastritis. Salmon
colored mucosa distributed in a segmental pattern, suggestive of
Barrett's Esophagus

Colonoscopy ([**2145**]): Normal


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 62 yo female with PMH CAD, MVR (on Coumadin),
AAA, Anemia, porphyria cutanea tarda presents with GI bleed in
setting of supratherapeutic [**Year (4 digits) 263**].
.
GI bleed: The patient presented with a HCT of 16/[**Year (4 digits) 263**] 8.5 and
melena/dark red blood.  The patient had a stable AAA and no
evidence of fistula on aortic u/s [**2148-5-3**]. DDx includes AVM,
ulcer, angioectasia, Dieulafoy's. An NG lavage was negative in
the ER.  She received 2 units FFP, vitamin K, and 2 units PRBC
in the ED.  We held her beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and Coumadin.  [**First Name3 (LF) 263**]
significantly decreased (to 2.5) after FFP and Vitamin K.  She
was started on IV Protonix [**Hospital1 **] and GI was consulted.  The
patient was admitted to the ICU and an EGD was performed.  There
were healed erosions but no evidence of acting bleeding.  She
was eventually transfused a total of 5 units of PRBC and her HCT
bumped to 38. HCT stabilized. She was scheduled for a
colonoscopy on [**2148-5-13**] which found erythema in the distal rectum
and anus most likely reflecting trauma from rectal tube. No
polyps, diverticula, or other findings to explain GI bleed. No
blood or clots seen in colon. The scope could not be passed
beyond ascending colon due to poor tolerance.  Will need to aim
for tight [**Date Range 263**] control.  If patient starts to bleed again while
on anticoagulation, will likely need capsule endoscopy. Patient
was discharged on Protonix.
.
CAD: Pt's recent chest pain is likely secondary to ischemia in
the setting of anemia, as seen on EKG (lateral depressions).
Enzymes were cycled and were negative.  She was continued on her
statin.  She had another episode of chest pain on the evening of
[**2148-5-11**] in which she was treated with SL nitro, Lasix, morphine,
and metoprolol.  Her EKG was unchanged.  A CXR showed pulmonary
edema.  Her symptoms quickly improved.  Cardiac enzymes were
again cycled and were negative. Continued on statin, Isordil,
beta [**Date Range 7005**], and aspirin.

.
s/p MVR: On Coumadin. Presented with supratherapeutic [**Date Range 263**] of
8.5. The patient was placed on a heparin drip after her [**Date Range 263**]
dropped below 2.5.  [**Date Range 263**] 3.2 on discharge.  Continue Coumadin
with plan to check [**Date Range 263**] on [**5-20**] as outpt.
.
History of CHF: Recent normal echo ([**4-25**]). On the patient second
night of admission she had an acute onset of chest tightness
with evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR.  She was treated with
10mg Lasix IV with improvement of symptoms.  She was restarted
on her home dose of Lasix 20mg QD.

stomach body and fundus compatible with gastritis. Salmon
colored mucosa distributed in a segmental pattern, suggestive of
Barrett's Esophagus

Colonoscopy ([**2145**]): Normal


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 62 yo female with PMH CAD, MVR (on Coumadin),
AAA, Anemia, porphyria cutanea tarda presents with GI bleed in
setting of supratherapeutic [**Year (4 digits) 263**].
.
GI bleed: The patient presented with a HCT of 16/[**Year (4 digits) 263**] 8.5 and
melena/dark red blood.  The patient had a stable AAA and no
evidence of fistula on aortic u/s [**2148-5-3**]. DDx includes AVM,
ulcer, angioectasia, Dieulafoy's. An NG lavage was negative in
the ER.  She received 2 units FFP, vitamin K, and 2 units PRBC
in the ED.  We held her beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and Coumadin.  [**First Name3 (LF) 263**]
significantly decreased (to 2.5) after FFP and Vitamin K.  She
was started on IV Protonix [**Hospital1 **] and GI was consulted.  The
patient was admitted to the ICU and an EGD was performed.  There
were healed erosions but no evidence of acting bleeding.  She
was eventually transfused a total of 5 units of PRBC and her HCT
bumped to 38. HCT stabilized. She was scheduled for a
colonoscopy on [**2148-5-13**] which found erythema in the distal rectum
and anus most likely reflecting trauma from rectal tube. No
polyps, diverticula, or other findings to explain GI bleed. No
blood or clots seen in colon. The scope could not be passed
beyond ascending colon due to poor tolerance.  Will need to aim
for tight [**Date Range 263**] control.  If patient starts to bleed again while
on anticoagulation, will likely need capsule endoscopy. Patient
was discharged on Protonix.
.
CAD: Pt's recent chest pain is likely secondary to ischemia in
the setting of anemia, as seen on EKG (lateral depressions).
Enzymes were cycled and were negative.  She was continued on her
statin.  She had another episode of chest pain on the evening of
[**2148-5-11**] in which she was treated with SL nitro, Lasix, morphine,
and metoprolol.  Her EKG was unchanged.  A CXR showed pulmonary
edema.  Her symptoms quickly improved.  Cardiac enzymes were
again cycled and were negative. Continued on statin, Isordil,
beta [**Date Range 7005**], and aspirin.

.
s/p MVR: On Coumadin. Presented with supratherapeutic [**Date Range 263**] of
8.5. The patient was placed on a heparin drip after her [**Date Range 263**]
dropped below 2.5.  [**Date Range 263**] 3.2 on discharge.  Continue Coumadin
with plan to check [**Date Range 263**] on [**5-20**] as outpt.
.
History of CHF: Recent normal echo ([**4-25**]). On the patient second
night of admission she had an acute onset of chest tightness
with evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR.  She was treated with
10mg Lasix IV with improvement of symptoms.  She was restarted
on her home dose of Lasix 20mg QD.

Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] last week for cardiac cath for
work up of recent DOE/SOB and increasing chest pain over the
past month. Cardiac cath revealed no changed - she had patent
RCA stents and LIMA to LAD. Pt was put on heparin bridge and
restarted on coumadin prior to discharge. Pt states that she saw
her PCP 3 days PTA (monday) to have her [**Hospital1 263**] checked, which was
3.2. On the day prior to admission, pt developed worsening
fatigue, weakness, and lightheadedness. She had a brief episode
of chest discomfort at rest, which she describes as a pressure
like feeling. That evening, pt had an episode of bloody
diarrhea, which she describes as black stool w/dark red blood
mixed in. Pt denies any prior hx of GIB. Pt denies hematemesis,
coffee ground emesis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  Denies
recent NSAID use, other that daily baby [**Hospital1 **]; denies steroid use.
Pt had no further episodes of bloody stools that evening. She
presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital the following morning. She
states she was given Vitamin K there and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].

In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was given 2U FFP, 2U PRBC. 3 large bore IVs were
placed. NG lavage was negative. Pt was seen by GI, who may
consider EGD in AM. EKG was noted to have ST depressions in the
lateral leads. She underwent colonoscopy  - were able to reach
the ascending colon - no obvious source of bleed. Patient has
been transfused a total of 7 U PRBCs since admission on [**5-9**]. No
further bloody bowel movements or melena during admission.
Ontransfer from unit to floor, pt denied CP, SOB, states
weakness/fatigue is improved.

been transfused a total of 7 U PRBCs since admission on [**5-9**]. No
further bloody bowel movements or melena during admission.
Ontransfer from unit to floor, pt denied CP, SOB, states
weakness/fatigue is improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 62 yo female with PMH CAD, MVR (on Coumadin),
AAA, Anemia, porphyria cutanea tarda presents with GI bleed in
setting of supratherapeutic [**Year (4 digits) 263**].
.
GI bleed: The patient presented with a HCT of 16/[**Year (4 digits) 263**] 8.5 and
melena/dark red blood.  The patient had a stable AAA and no
evidence of fistula on aortic u/s [**2148-5-3**]. DDx includes AVM,
ulcer, angioectasia, Dieulafoy's. An NG lavage was negative in
the ER.  She received 2 units FFP, vitamin K, and 2 units PRBC
in the ED.  We held her beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and Coumadin.  [**First Name3 (LF) 263**]
significantly decreased (to 2.5) after FFP and Vitamin K.  She
was started on IV Protonix [**Hospital1 **] and GI was consulted.  The
patient was admitted to the ICU and an EGD was performed.  There
were healed erosions but no evidence of acting bleeding.  She
was eventually transfused a total of 5 units of PRBC and her HCT
bumped to 38. HCT stabilized. She was scheduled for a
colonoscopy on [**2148-5-13**] which found erythema in the distal rectum
and anus most likely reflecting trauma from rectal tube. No
polyps, diverticula, or other findings to explain GI bleed. No
blood or clots seen in colon. The scope could not be passed
beyond ascending colon due to poor tolerance.  Will need to aim
for tight [**Date Range 263**] control.  If patient starts to bleed again while
on anticoagulation, will likely need capsule endoscopy. Patient
was discharged on Protonix.
.
CAD: Pt's recent chest pain is likely secondary to ischemia in
the setting of anemia, as seen on EKG (lateral depressions).
Enzymes were cycled and were negative.  She was continued on her
statin.  She had another episode of chest pain on the evening of
[**2148-5-11**] in which she was treated with SL nitro, Lasix, morphine,
and metoprolol.  Her EKG was unchanged.  A CXR showed pulmonary
edema.  Her symptoms quickly improved.  Cardiac enzymes were
again cycled and were negative. Continued on statin, Isordil,
beta [**Date Range 7005**], and aspirin.

.
s/p MVR: On Coumadin. Presented with supratherapeutic [**Date Range 263**] of
8.5. The patient was placed on a heparin drip after her [**Date Range 263**]
dropped below 2.5.  [**Date Range 263**] 3.2 on discharge.  Continue Coumadin
with plan to check [**Date Range 263**] on [**5-20**] as outpt.
.
History of CHF: Recent normal echo ([**4-25**]). On the patient second
night of admission she had an acute onset of chest tightness
with evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR.  She was treated with
10mg Lasix IV with improvement of symptoms.  She was restarted
on her home dose of Lasix 20mg QD.
.
CRI: Creatinine at baseline
.
Trigeminal Neuralgia: continued on Dilaudid and fentanyl patch.

.
Insomnia: continued amitriptyline qhs.
.
Hyperlipidemia: continued Lipitor.
