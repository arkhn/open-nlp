History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 yo M with PMH of CAD/CABG, DM, CRI, AAA/TAA
repair, multiple CVA, seizure d/o who presented to the ED w/
respiratory distress. Son reports 4 days of lethargy, decreased
POs, 'not walking at all,' and wet, non-productive cough. He
also reports subjective fever the morning of admission. His son
states that his father did not complain of any chest pain,
abdominal pain or dysuria. He has had normal bowel movements. He
lives at home with wife and was seen there today by NP who
referred him to the ED. He denied abdominal
pain/nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/CP/SOB.

On arrival to [**Name (NI) **] pt was tachypneic w/ RR 35, BP 198/122, T 101.2
rectally, sats 70s on RA, 85 on NRB, RLL crackles and rhonchi.
He had a CXR that showed multilobar pneumonia. He was intubated
for respiratory distress with VBG showing 7.28/50/56. Other
significant labs were; BNP 2458, Trop 0.06, Lactate 3.4. His
blood pressure had been in the high 100's systolic and dropped
initially to 90's then to 54/33 after receiving propofol. He
then received 6L NS and peripheral dopa was started. A RIJ
placed and started on central levophed and dopamine per sepsis
protocol (on low dose for both (124/70). He received Levaquin
750mg IV and Ceftriaxone 1gm and was consented for sepsis
research study.

On arrival to floor, ABG was 7.32/45/327 on AC @100% w/ PEEP 10
and FiO2 was decreased to 60. He was started on fentanyl/versed
gtt for sedation, and dopa and levo for BP support.

REPORTS AND STUDIES

ECHO [**3-21**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is
normal (LVEF 60-70%); however, the basal segments of the
inferior septum, inferior free wall, and posterior wall are
hypokinetic. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is moderately dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2119-5-6**], the mitral regurgitation appears reduced;
however, this suboptimal study may have underestimated the
mitral regurgitation.

CXR [**2121-4-1**]
In comparison with the study of [**3-31**], there is little overall
change. Tubes remain in place in this patient with median
sternotomy and pacemaker leads. Hazy opacification of the lower
half of the right hemithorax is again seen, consistent with
pleural fluid. Some asymmetric pulmonary edema, worse on the
right, is suggested.

CXR [**2121-4-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
single lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic venous
approach. Final internal length is 43 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77 yo M with PMH of CAD/CABG, DM, CRI, AAA/TAA repair,
multiple CVA who presented initially with RLL pneumonia,
admitted to the MICU intubated [**3-1**] to respiratory distress and
hypotension, extubated briefly, then reintubated secondary to
increased secretions.
.
#) Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Upon initial presentation, the
patient had had 4 days of lethargy, and increased cough with
inability to clear sputum.  The patient was intubated initially
and started on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.  Flagyl was
additionally added; The patient's vent was titrated according to
ABGs.  Ceftriaxone was discontinued  on [**3-25**].  The patient was
extubated on [**3-26**], but required reintubation the subsequent day
for respiratory distress, presumed secondary to thick
secretions.  A pneumonia was seen on CXR, and the patient was
started on zosyn and vancomycin.  The patient had a trach, PEG
and central line placed on [**2-/2042**].  Pressure support was weaned as
tolerated, but he may require more ventilator support for
transport.  Zosyn and vancomycin are to be continued for an 8
day course for PNA. Zosyn and vanc are to be given via PICC for
1 more days for 8 days total.  PICC lines was placed on [**2118-4-2**]
and is ok for use.  Last day of vancomycin and zosyn will be
[**2121-4-4**].
.
#) Hypotension/Sepsis:  On initial presentation, pt was
hypertensive to 200s/100s, but BP began to drop after
intubation.  IV dopamine and fluids were started, BP increased.
The patient was pan-cultured.  The patient's pressors were
weaned and fluid boluses were given as necessary. Resolved.
.
#) Hypernatremia: Initial sodium was 160.  The patient did not
appear volume-overloaded on arrival to the medical floor despite
receiving 6 L NS.  Most likely cause was thought to be
dehydration from not drinking water.  The free water deficit was
calculated and the patient was given free water to bring his
sodium down.  His electrolytes were closely monitored.  He can
continue to get free water with his tube feeds as needed.
.
#) A-fib/A-flutter: pt has a history of this, controlled on
sotolol and metoprolol. During admission, he went into a-fib
with rvr and a-flutter but this wsa controlled with uptitration
of medications including calcium channel blocker & beta blocker.

- Continue lopressor and diltiazam for control (can titrate up
if needed)
.
#) Renal Failure: Cr 1.8 on admission, elevated BUN/Cr ratio
suggests at least partial pre-renal etiology although pt has
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline Cr of 1.6. Currently,
creatinine stable and at baseline, creatinine 1.3 at discharge.

.
#) Mental Status - Pt still remains largely unarousable despite
being off of sedating medications. Per discussion with family,
his baseline is poor to start.
- continue to hold sedating medications.
.
#.) Anemia-Pt received 1 U PRBC on [**3-31**] for a Hct of 24.9, with
an apppropriate hematocrit elevation. Hematocrit 32.6 at time of
discharge.
.
#) CAD: h/o CAD s/p CABG X 3 VD (70% distal LMCA, 100% PDA/PLV)

- continue ASA, statin
.
#) Pump: last ECHO [**5-4**] = LEVF 50%, no signs of volume overload
at present.
.
#) Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
.
#) DM: Continue glargine 20 U hs and insulin per sliding scale.

.
#) F/E/N: IVF prn. Replete lytes PRN. TF at goal.
.
#) PPx: Bowel regimen, PPI, pneumoboots, heparin SC TID while
nonambulatory.
.
#) Access: PICC
.
#) Code Status: DNR.  Patient would like no CPR, no shock, but
vasopressors okay.

REPORTS AND STUDIES

ECHO [**3-21**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is
normal (LVEF 60-70%); however, the basal segments of the
inferior septum, inferior free wall, and posterior wall are
hypokinetic. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is moderately dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2119-5-6**], the mitral regurgitation appears reduced;
however, this suboptimal study may have underestimated the
mitral regurgitation.

CXR [**2121-4-1**]
In comparison with the study of [**3-31**], there is little overall
change. Tubes remain in place in this patient with median
sternotomy and pacemaker leads. Hazy opacification of the lower
half of the right hemithorax is again seen, consistent with
pleural fluid. Some asymmetric pulmonary edema, worse on the
right, is suggested.

CXR [**2121-4-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
single lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic venous
approach. Final internal length is 43 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77 yo M with PMH of CAD/CABG, DM, CRI, AAA/TAA repair,
multiple CVA who presented initially with RLL pneumonia,
admitted to the MICU intubated [**3-1**] to respiratory distress and
hypotension, extubated briefly, then reintubated secondary to
increased secretions.
.
#) Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Upon initial presentation, the
patient had had 4 days of lethargy, and increased cough with
inability to clear sputum.  The patient was intubated initially
and started on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.  Flagyl was
additionally added; The patient's vent was titrated according to
ABGs.  Ceftriaxone was discontinued  on [**3-25**].  The patient was
extubated on [**3-26**], but required reintubation the subsequent day
for respiratory distress, presumed secondary to thick
secretions.  A pneumonia was seen on CXR, and the patient was
started on zosyn and vancomycin.  The patient had a trach, PEG
and central line placed on [**2-/2042**].  Pressure support was weaned as
tolerated, but he may require more ventilator support for
transport.  Zosyn and vancomycin are to be continued for an 8
day course for PNA. Zosyn and vanc are to be given via PICC for
1 more days for 8 days total.  PICC lines was placed on [**2118-4-2**]
and is ok for use.  Last day of vancomycin and zosyn will be
[**2121-4-4**].
.
#) Hypotension/Sepsis:  On initial presentation, pt was
hypertensive to 200s/100s, but BP began to drop after
intubation.  IV dopamine and fluids were started, BP increased.
The patient was pan-cultured.  The patient's pressors were
weaned and fluid boluses were given as necessary. Resolved.
.
#) Hypernatremia: Initial sodium was 160.  The patient did not
appear volume-overloaded on arrival to the medical floor despite
receiving 6 L NS.  Most likely cause was thought to be
dehydration from not drinking water.  The free water deficit was
calculated and the patient was given free water to bring his
sodium down.  His electrolytes were closely monitored.  He can
continue to get free water with his tube feeds as needed.
.
#) A-fib/A-flutter: pt has a history of this, controlled on
sotolol and metoprolol. During admission, he went into a-fib
with rvr and a-flutter but this wsa controlled with uptitration
of medications including calcium channel blocker & beta blocker.

- Continue lopressor and diltiazam for control (can titrate up
if needed)
.
#) Renal Failure: Cr 1.8 on admission, elevated BUN/Cr ratio
suggests at least partial pre-renal etiology although pt has
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline Cr of 1.6. Currently,
creatinine stable and at baseline, creatinine 1.3 at discharge.

.
#) Mental Status - Pt still remains largely unarousable despite
being off of sedating medications. Per discussion with family,
his baseline is poor to start.
- continue to hold sedating medications.
.
#.) Anemia-Pt received 1 U PRBC on [**3-31**] for a Hct of 24.9, with
an apppropriate hematocrit elevation. Hematocrit 32.6 at time of
discharge.
.
#) CAD: h/o CAD s/p CABG X 3 VD (70% distal LMCA, 100% PDA/PLV)

- continue ASA, statin
.
#) Pump: last ECHO [**5-4**] = LEVF 50%, no signs of volume overload
at present.
.
#) Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
.
#) DM: Continue glargine 20 U hs and insulin per sliding scale.

.
#) F/E/N: IVF prn. Replete lytes PRN. TF at goal.
.
#) PPx: Bowel regimen, PPI, pneumoboots, heparin SC TID while
nonambulatory.
.
#) Access: PICC
.
#) Code Status: DNR.  Patient would like no CPR, no shock, but
vasopressors okay.
.

additionally added; The patient's vent was titrated according to
ABGs.  Ceftriaxone was discontinued  on [**3-25**].  The patient was
extubated on [**3-26**], but required reintubation the subsequent day
for respiratory distress, presumed secondary to thick
secretions.  A pneumonia was seen on CXR, and the patient was
started on zosyn and vancomycin.  The patient had a trach, PEG
and central line placed on [**2-/2042**].  Pressure support was weaned as
tolerated, but he may require more ventilator support for
transport.  Zosyn and vancomycin are to be continued for an 8
day course for PNA. Zosyn and vanc are to be given via PICC for
1 more days for 8 days total.  PICC lines was placed on [**2118-4-2**]
and is ok for use.  Last day of vancomycin and zosyn will be
[**2121-4-4**].
.
#) Hypotension/Sepsis:  On initial presentation, pt was
hypertensive to 200s/100s, but BP began to drop after
intubation.  IV dopamine and fluids were started, BP increased.
The patient was pan-cultured.  The patient's pressors were
weaned and fluid boluses were given as necessary. Resolved.
.
#) Hypernatremia: Initial sodium was 160.  The patient did not
appear volume-overloaded on arrival to the medical floor despite
receiving 6 L NS.  Most likely cause was thought to be
dehydration from not drinking water.  The free water deficit was
calculated and the patient was given free water to bring his
sodium down.  His electrolytes were closely monitored.  He can
continue to get free water with his tube feeds as needed.
.
#) A-fib/A-flutter: pt has a history of this, controlled on
sotolol and metoprolol. During admission, he went into a-fib
with rvr and a-flutter but this wsa controlled with uptitration
of medications including calcium channel blocker & beta blocker.

- Continue lopressor and diltiazam for control (can titrate up
if needed)
.
#) Renal Failure: Cr 1.8 on admission, elevated BUN/Cr ratio
suggests at least partial pre-renal etiology although pt has
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline Cr of 1.6. Currently,
creatinine stable and at baseline, creatinine 1.3 at discharge.

.
#) Mental Status - Pt still remains largely unarousable despite
being off of sedating medications. Per discussion with family,
his baseline is poor to start.
- continue to hold sedating medications.
.
#.) Anemia-Pt received 1 U PRBC on [**3-31**] for a Hct of 24.9, with
an apppropriate hematocrit elevation. Hematocrit 32.6 at time of
discharge.
.
#) CAD: h/o CAD s/p CABG X 3 VD (70% distal LMCA, 100% PDA/PLV)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 yo M with PMH of CAD/CABG, DM, CRI, AAA/TAA
repair, multiple CVA, seizure d/o who presented to the ED w/
respiratory distress. Son reports 4 days of lethargy, decreased
POs, 'not walking at all,' and wet, non-productive cough. He
also reports subjective fever the morning of admission. His son
states that his father did not complain of any chest pain,
abdominal pain or dysuria. He has had normal bowel movements. He
lives at home with wife and was seen there today by NP who
referred him to the ED. He denied abdominal
pain/nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/CP/SOB.

On arrival to [**Name (NI) **] pt was tachypneic w/ RR 35, BP 198/122, T 101.2
rectally, sats 70s on RA, 85 on NRB, RLL crackles and rhonchi.
He had a CXR that showed multilobar pneumonia. He was intubated
for respiratory distress with VBG showing 7.28/50/56. Other
significant labs were; BNP 2458, Trop 0.06, Lactate 3.4. His
blood pressure had been in the high 100's systolic and dropped
initially to 90's then to 54/33 after receiving propofol. He
then received 6L NS and peripheral dopa was started. A RIJ
placed and started on central levophed and dopamine per sepsis
protocol (on low dose for both (124/70). He received Levaquin
750mg IV and Ceftriaxone 1gm and was consented for sepsis
research study.

On arrival to floor, ABG was 7.32/45/327 on AC @100% w/ PEEP 10
and FiO2 was decreased to 60. He was started on fentanyl/versed
gtt for sedation, and dopa and levo for BP support.

REPORTS AND STUDIES

ECHO [**3-21**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is
normal (LVEF 60-70%); however, the basal segments of the
inferior septum, inferior free wall, and posterior wall are
hypokinetic. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is moderately dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2119-5-6**], the mitral regurgitation appears reduced;
however, this suboptimal study may have underestimated the
mitral regurgitation.

CXR [**2121-4-1**]
In comparison with the study of [**3-31**], there is little overall
change. Tubes remain in place in this patient with median
sternotomy and pacemaker leads. Hazy opacification of the lower
half of the right hemithorax is again seen, consistent with
pleural fluid. Some asymmetric pulmonary edema, worse on the
right, is suggested.

CXR [**2121-4-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
single lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic venous
approach. Final internal length is 43 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77 yo M with PMH of CAD/CABG, DM, CRI, AAA/TAA repair,
multiple CVA who presented initially with RLL pneumonia,
admitted to the MICU intubated [**3-1**] to respiratory distress and
hypotension, extubated briefly, then reintubated secondary to
increased secretions.
.
#) Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Upon initial presentation, the
patient had had 4 days of lethargy, and increased cough with
inability to clear sputum.  The patient was intubated initially
and started on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.  Flagyl was
additionally added; The patient's vent was titrated according to
ABGs.  Ceftriaxone was discontinued  on [**3-25**].  The patient was
extubated on [**3-26**], but required reintubation the subsequent day
for respiratory distress, presumed secondary to thick
secretions.  A pneumonia was seen on CXR, and the patient was
started on zosyn and vancomycin.  The patient had a trach, PEG
and central line placed on [**2-/2042**].  Pressure support was weaned as
tolerated, but he may require more ventilator support for
transport.  Zosyn and vancomycin are to be continued for an 8
day course for PNA. Zosyn and vanc are to be given via PICC for
1 more days for 8 days total.  PICC lines was placed on [**2118-4-2**]
and is ok for use.  Last day of vancomycin and zosyn will be

REPORTS AND STUDIES

ECHO [**3-21**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is
normal (LVEF 60-70%); however, the basal segments of the
inferior septum, inferior free wall, and posterior wall are
hypokinetic. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is moderately dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2119-5-6**], the mitral regurgitation appears reduced;
however, this suboptimal study may have underestimated the
mitral regurgitation.

CXR [**2121-4-1**]
In comparison with the study of [**3-31**], there is little overall
change. Tubes remain in place in this patient with median
sternotomy and pacemaker leads. Hazy opacification of the lower
half of the right hemithorax is again seen, consistent with
pleural fluid. Some asymmetric pulmonary edema, worse on the
right, is suggested.

CXR [**2121-4-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
single lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic venous
approach. Final internal length is 43 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77 yo M with PMH of CAD/CABG, DM, CRI, AAA/TAA repair,
multiple CVA who presented initially with RLL pneumonia,
admitted to the MICU intubated [**3-1**] to respiratory distress and
hypotension, extubated briefly, then reintubated secondary to
increased secretions.
.
#) Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Upon initial presentation, the
patient had had 4 days of lethargy, and increased cough with
inability to clear sputum.  The patient was intubated initially
and started on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.  Flagyl was
additionally added; The patient's vent was titrated according to
ABGs.  Ceftriaxone was discontinued  on [**3-25**].  The patient was
extubated on [**3-26**], but required reintubation the subsequent day
for respiratory distress, presumed secondary to thick
secretions.  A pneumonia was seen on CXR, and the patient was
started on zosyn and vancomycin.  The patient had a trach, PEG
and central line placed on [**2-/2042**].  Pressure support was weaned as
tolerated, but he may require more ventilator support for
transport.  Zosyn and vancomycin are to be continued for an 8
day course for PNA. Zosyn and vanc are to be given via PICC for
1 more days for 8 days total.  PICC lines was placed on [**2118-4-2**]
and is ok for use.  Last day of vancomycin and zosyn will be
[**2121-4-4**].
.
#) Hypotension/Sepsis:  On initial presentation, pt was
hypertensive to 200s/100s, but BP began to drop after
intubation.  IV dopamine and fluids were started, BP increased.
The patient was pan-cultured.  The patient's pressors were
weaned and fluid boluses were given as necessary. Resolved.
.
#) Hypernatremia: Initial sodium was 160.  The patient did not
appear volume-overloaded on arrival to the medical floor despite
receiving 6 L NS.  Most likely cause was thought to be
dehydration from not drinking water.  The free water deficit was
calculated and the patient was given free water to bring his
sodium down.  His electrolytes were closely monitored.  He can
continue to get free water with his tube feeds as needed.
.
#) A-fib/A-flutter: pt has a history of this, controlled on
sotolol and metoprolol. During admission, he went into a-fib
with rvr and a-flutter but this wsa controlled with uptitration
of medications including calcium channel blocker & beta blocker.

- Continue lopressor and diltiazam for control (can titrate up
if needed)
.
#) Renal Failure: Cr 1.8 on admission, elevated BUN/Cr ratio
suggests at least partial pre-renal etiology although pt has
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline Cr of 1.6. Currently,
creatinine stable and at baseline, creatinine 1.3 at discharge.

.
#) Mental Status - Pt still remains largely unarousable despite
being off of sedating medications. Per discussion with family,
his baseline is poor to start.
- continue to hold sedating medications.
.
#.) Anemia-Pt received 1 U PRBC on [**3-31**] for a Hct of 24.9, with
an apppropriate hematocrit elevation. Hematocrit 32.6 at time of
discharge.
.
#) CAD: h/o CAD s/p CABG X 3 VD (70% distal LMCA, 100% PDA/PLV)

- continue ASA, statin
.
#) Pump: last ECHO [**5-4**] = LEVF 50%, no signs of volume overload
at present.
.
#) Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
.
#) DM: Continue glargine 20 U hs and insulin per sliding scale.

.
#) F/E/N: IVF prn. Replete lytes PRN. TF at goal.
.
#) PPx: Bowel regimen, PPI, pneumoboots, heparin SC TID while
nonambulatory.
.
#) Access: PICC
.
#) Code Status: DNR.  Patient would like no CPR, no shock, but
vasopressors okay.

Chief Complaint:
Suicide attempt, overdose, NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Intubation
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 59 yo woman with PMH severe depression, migraine
has, recent weight loss w/ negative work up who presents from
[**Hospital3 **] today after suicide attempt, c/b NSTEMI.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2108-3-18**] after
overdosing on pills.  She apparently called her grandson stating
that she had taken ""45 pills"".  On evaluation of her pill
bottles, it appears as though she took Zyprexa and Adderall.
She was found minimally responsive by her husband at 2pm on
[**2108-3-18**] who called EMS.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 **], patient was intubated, given charcoal and
NG lavage, and admitted to ICU for managment.  On admission, pt
was noted to be tachycardic, but vital signs otherwise stable.
Labs were essentially WNL.  Tox screen was negative for benzos,
cocaine, tricyclics, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, asa,
small amt + of tylenol at 1.7.  Initial EKG demonstrated sinus
tachycardia at [**Street Address(2) 65762**] depressions in V1 and diffuse ST
elevations with PR depressions.  In terms of her overdose,
poison control was contact[**Name (NI) **] and patient was monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
was of concern with her Zyprexa overdose, but did not exhibit
any of these signs.  She was otherwise maintained with
supportive care.
Patient was also noted to have Troponin trend from 0.09 night of
admission to 0.03 to 4.5.  EKG on 2nd day of hospitalization
demonstrated ST elevations in lateral leads which were more
pronounced than on admission.  Patient was not placed on heparin
gtt as it was believed that this troponin elevation was more
likely [**2-9**] strain, as patient had had recent cardiac w/u as
outpt that was negative.
Hospital course otherwise notable for some hypoxia with
borderline O2 sats on 100% FiO2- CXR at that time demonstrated
some evidence of aspiration pna and ?CHF.  Pt's WBC also rose to
16.  Patient was therefore started on unasyn for broad spectrum
coverage.  Patient also developed hypotension, thought ?[**2-9**] pna,
and pt was placed transiently on neosynephrine for BP control,
although was off pressors on transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for managment of her
MI and her pulmonary status.
Currently patient is intubated and sedated.

Past Medical History:
(per OSH records):
1.) Depression
2.) Migraine HA
3.) Chronic pain
4.) 100 lb weight loss over past year - pt has undergone
extensive w/u including colonoscopy, GYN exam, HIV test, cardiac
w/u, stool studies, celiac studies negative.  Also had abd CT
negative, Chest CT demonstrated LUL nodule which was monitered.
Had recent scan that demonstrated increase in size of LUL nodule
from 3mm->7mm, PET scan in [**12-11**] negative - scheduled to have
repeat Chest CT this month.


Social History:
Patient is married, lives w/ husband and 14 [**Name2 (NI) **] grandson.  +
family stress due to death of her son from heroin overdose about
2 years ago.  Also has daughter w/ current substance abuse
problems.  Remote tobacco history.

Imaging:
[**2108-3-19**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe pulmonary opacity, likely representing
aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-19**] Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA, LAD that had mild 30% mid vessel lesion, LCx that
was
without obstructive disease and the RCA had a mid vessel 60%
lesion.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed low normal RAp, elevated PaP
with
marked respiratory variation and normal PCWP. The CI was 2.4.
There was
systemic hypotension with narrow pulse pressure. This was
consistent
with septic shock.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
.
[**2108-3-20**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to extensive apical
akinesis, with contractile function improving toward the base of
the heart. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2108-3-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of pulmonary
edema. Interval improvement of bibasilar opacities, which may
represent residual changes from aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-22**]: CT Chest with Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation worrisome for multifocal
pneumonia. Given the distribution, aspiration is also a
consideration. Followup after an appropriate clinical interval
post-treatment is recommended to demonstrate complete
resolution.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, and interlobular septal
thickening that may suggest fluid overload.
3. 3 mm nodule in the right lower lobe. In the absence of known
primary malignancy, followup in twelve months may be performed,
in the presence of known primary malignancy, followup in three
months is recommended.
.
[**2108-3-26**]: CXR:
There has been interval extubation and removal of the
nasogastric tube. A right PICC line terminates in the lower
superior vena cava. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within
normal limits. There are bibasilar areas of increased opacity
adjacent to small-to-moderate pleural effusions. The left lower
lobe opacity is slightly improved in the interval. The right
basilar opacity is difficult to compare due to the increasing
effusion and differences in positioning of the patient.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar consolidation in keeping with history of
aspiration pneumonia with interval improvement in left
retrocardiac area. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.

# Aspiration PNA/MSSA sepsis:  The patient was started on levo
([**3-19**]) at admission and then added vanc the following day.  Her
sputum and Bcx (1 out of 4) from admission grew out MSSA.  The
patient finished 7 day course of levoquin (750mg/day) on [**3-25**]
and was switched to oxacillin on [**3-25**] as BCX came back as MSSA.
The patient will finish 14 day course oxacillin on [**4-2**].  She
was on levophed for septic shock and has been off for >36hours
with SBP in high 80s-100s prior to call-out to the floor.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was initially intubated for airway
protection after found unresponsive and subsequently found to
have bilateral pneumonia thought to be [**2-9**] aspiration.  The
patient was extubated on [**3-23**] and has required high O2, so
empirically started short-course prednisone (5days) for presumed
COPD exacerbation on [**3-25**].
.
# Cardiac:
A. Ischemia:  Patient with flat troponins on initial
presentation to OSH, then trended up.  No history of CAD and per
OSH records, had recent cardiac w/u which was negative.  EKG on
initial presentation to OSH demonstrates diffuse ST elevation
and PR depression.  EKG on day of transfer demonstrates
anterolateral ST elevation with reciprical inferior changes.  Pt
went to cath on night of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**3-19**]) that
demonstrated no significant CAD (30% LAD, 60% RCA), more septic
physiology.  The patient was started on ASA.  Due to
hypotension, carvedilol was started but never given.  Lipitor
was not started as cholesterol was low.
.
B. Pump:  Patient appears clinically euvolemia, no hx of CHF.
ECHO [**3-20**] demonstrated LV systolic dysfxn with EF 20-30% [**2-9**]
extensive apical akinesis, also 3+ MR.  This was thought to be
stress-induced cardiomyopathy.  Will need a BB and ACEI once BP
stable and as BP tolerates.  The patient has been auto-diuresing
without needing lasix for all the fluid she received for sepsis.

.
C. Rhythm:  Was in sinus tachy on presentation, now in NSR.  No
prolongation of intervals on EKG.
.
# Suicide attempt/OD:  Per OSH records, pt OD on zyprexa and
adderall.  Seen by poison control at OSH - monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
were not noted.  Tox screen neg at OSH.  After extubation, she
was placed on CIWA scale and 1:1 sitter for possible alcoholism
and SI.  The patient was also evaluated by psych who recommended
d/cing 1:1 sitter and CIWA as pt was no longer suicidal and had
no previous ETOH abuse.  Pt was also started on Remeron per
psych recs.  On discharge from unit, pt was not suicidal and
although admits depression and anxiety.
.
# FEN:  Started TFs w/ nutrition recs while intubated.  Once
extubated, started po diet as tolerated. Repleted lytes K to 4
and mag to 2.
.
# PPX:  SC heparin, lansoprazole, colace
.
# Code status:  Full
.
Patient was discharged from the ICU onto the floor and remained
without a sitter. Since she was not exhibiting signs of SI to
the psych service, SW or to us, it was felt that reinstituting a
sitter would be seen as punitive. During her stay, patient
expressed remorse for her suicide attempt and plans for
restarting her life. Psychiatry felt that the patient was safe
to discharge home with her attending a day program at [**Hospital 882**]
hospital and in addition to having regular meetings with her
therapist, which she agreed to and was arranged. In addition,
she was discharged with a crisis plan in place which was
explained to the patient.
.
She was continued on IV oxacillin and was changed to Levofloacin
on discharge - since her bacteremia was also succeptible to this
antibiotics. She was prescribed enough Levoquin until [**4-2**] (end
of 14 day course of total antibiotics). She did not spike any
fevers while on the floor and surveillance blood cultures were
negative from [**3-20**] and [**3-22**]. Follow up urine cultures were also
negative.
.
Patient's BP remained in the 80s-90s for much of her stay on the
floor making it difficult to add on BB and ACE-I. On discharge,
her SBP rose to 108. Hence low dose metoprolol was initiated.
She was on ASA on the floor. 20mg lipitor was started on
discharge. (Lipid panel showed LDL of 54 and HDL of 43)
.
During her stay on the floor, she was walked with PT and her
oxygen requirements were weaned down slowly; on discharge
patient was completely off of oxygen and was comfortable. Repeat
CXR on [**3-26**] showed resolution of her pulmonary edema. She
finished a 5 day course of steroids for putative bronchospasm in
the hospital and was maintained on nebulizers.
------
Outstanding issues:
- Patient would likely benefit from starting an ACE-I as an
outpatient.
- Patient was on adderall and topamax as outpatient; these were
discontinued and will not be restarted; In particular, the
adderall may have played a significant part in the drastic
weight loss that the patient has experienced over the past year.

In addition, patient will need basic oncologic screening - in
particular, her pulmonary nodule will need follow up - per
Radiology here at [**Hospital1 **], it was recommended that this nodule be
followed up in [**3-12**] months with repeat CT.
- For her depressed EF, she will need a follow up ECHO,
particularly in the event that she may have a depressed EF due
to myocardial stress

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Suicide attempt, overdose, NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Intubation
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 59 yo woman with PMH severe depression, migraine
has, recent weight loss w/ negative work up who presents from
[**Hospital3 **] today after suicide attempt, c/b NSTEMI.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2108-3-18**] after
overdosing on pills.  She apparently called her grandson stating
that she had taken ""45 pills"".  On evaluation of her pill
bottles, it appears as though she took Zyprexa and Adderall.
She was found minimally responsive by her husband at 2pm on
[**2108-3-18**] who called EMS.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 **], patient was intubated, given charcoal and
NG lavage, and admitted to ICU for managment.  On admission, pt
was noted to be tachycardic, but vital signs otherwise stable.
Labs were essentially WNL.  Tox screen was negative for benzos,
cocaine, tricyclics, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, asa,
small amt + of tylenol at 1.7.  Initial EKG demonstrated sinus
tachycardia at [**Street Address(2) 65762**] depressions in V1 and diffuse ST
elevations with PR depressions.  In terms of her overdose,
poison control was contact[**Name (NI) **] and patient was monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
was of concern with her Zyprexa overdose, but did not exhibit
any of these signs.  She was otherwise maintained with
supportive care.
Patient was also noted to have Troponin trend from 0.09 night of
admission to 0.03 to 4.5.  EKG on 2nd day of hospitalization
demonstrated ST elevations in lateral leads which were more
pronounced than on admission.  Patient was not placed on heparin
gtt as it was believed that this troponin elevation was more
likely [**2-9**] strain, as patient had had recent cardiac w/u as
outpt that was negative.
Hospital course otherwise notable for some hypoxia with
borderline O2 sats on 100% FiO2- CXR at that time demonstrated
some evidence of aspiration pna and ?CHF.  Pt's WBC also rose to
16.  Patient was therefore started on unasyn for broad spectrum
coverage.  Patient also developed hypotension, thought ?[**2-9**] pna,
and pt was placed transiently on neosynephrine for BP control,
although was off pressors on transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for managment of her
MI and her pulmonary status.
Currently patient is intubated and sedated.

Past Medical History:
(per OSH records):
1.) Depression
2.) Migraine HA
3.) Chronic pain
4.) 100 lb weight loss over past year - pt has undergone
extensive w/u including colonoscopy, GYN exam, HIV test, cardiac
w/u, stool studies, celiac studies negative.  Also had abd CT
negative, Chest CT demonstrated LUL nodule which was monitered.
Had recent scan that demonstrated increase in size of LUL nodule
from 3mm->7mm, PET scan in [**12-11**] negative - scheduled to have
repeat Chest CT this month.


Social History:
Patient is married, lives w/ husband and 14 [**Name2 (NI) **] grandson.  +
family stress due to death of her son from heroin overdose about
2 years ago.  Also has daughter w/ current substance abuse
problems.  Remote tobacco history.

Imaging:
[**2108-3-19**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe pulmonary opacity, likely representing
aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-19**] Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA, LAD that had mild 30% mid vessel lesion, LCx that
was
without obstructive disease and the RCA had a mid vessel 60%
lesion.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed low normal RAp, elevated PaP
with
marked respiratory variation and normal PCWP. The CI was 2.4.
There was
systemic hypotension with narrow pulse pressure. This was
consistent
with septic shock.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
.
[**2108-3-20**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to extensive apical
akinesis, with contractile function improving toward the base of
the heart. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2108-3-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of pulmonary
edema. Interval improvement of bibasilar opacities, which may
represent residual changes from aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-22**]: CT Chest with Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation worrisome for multifocal
pneumonia. Given the distribution, aspiration is also a
consideration. Followup after an appropriate clinical interval
post-treatment is recommended to demonstrate complete
resolution.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, and interlobular septal
thickening that may suggest fluid overload.
3. 3 mm nodule in the right lower lobe. In the absence of known
primary malignancy, followup in twelve months may be performed,
in the presence of known primary malignancy, followup in three
months is recommended.
.
[**2108-3-26**]: CXR:
There has been interval extubation and removal of the
nasogastric tube. A right PICC line terminates in the lower
superior vena cava. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within
normal limits. There are bibasilar areas of increased opacity
adjacent to small-to-moderate pleural effusions. The left lower
lobe opacity is slightly improved in the interval. The right
basilar opacity is difficult to compare due to the increasing
effusion and differences in positioning of the patient.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar consolidation in keeping with history of
aspiration pneumonia with interval improvement in left
retrocardiac area. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:  Patient is 59 yo woman without known cardiac
history, presented to OSH with suicide attempt o/d on zyprexa
and adderall, now intubated w/ pna and course c/b NSTEMI.
.
# Aspiration PNA/MSSA sepsis:  The patient was started on levo
([**3-19**]) at admission and then added vanc the following day.  Her
sputum and Bcx (1 out of 4) from admission grew out MSSA.  The
patient finished 7 day course of levoquin (750mg/day) on [**3-25**]
and was switched to oxacillin on [**3-25**] as BCX came back as MSSA.
The patient will finish 14 day course oxacillin on [**4-2**].  She
was on levophed for septic shock and has been off for >36hours
with SBP in high 80s-100s prior to call-out to the floor.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was initially intubated for airway
protection after found unresponsive and subsequently found to
have bilateral pneumonia thought to be [**2-9**] aspiration.  The
patient was extubated on [**3-23**] and has required high O2, so
empirically started short-course prednisone (5days) for presumed
COPD exacerbation on [**3-25**].
.
# Cardiac:
A. Ischemia:  Patient with flat troponins on initial
presentation to OSH, then trended up.  No history of CAD and per
OSH records, had recent cardiac w/u which was negative.  EKG on
initial presentation to OSH demonstrates diffuse ST elevation
and PR depression.  EKG on day of transfer demonstrates
anterolateral ST elevation with reciprical inferior changes.  Pt
went to cath on night of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**3-19**]) that
demonstrated no significant CAD (30% LAD, 60% RCA), more septic
physiology.  The patient was started on ASA.  Due to
hypotension, carvedilol was started but never given.  Lipitor
was not started as cholesterol was low.
.
B. Pump:  Patient appears clinically euvolemia, no hx of CHF.
ECHO [**3-20**] demonstrated LV systolic dysfxn with EF 20-30% [**2-9**]
extensive apical akinesis, also 3+ MR.  This was thought to be
stress-induced cardiomyopathy.  Will need a BB and ACEI once BP
stable and as BP tolerates.  The patient has been auto-diuresing
without needing lasix for all the fluid she received for sepsis.

C. Rhythm:  Was in sinus tachy on presentation, now in NSR.  No
prolongation of intervals on EKG.
.
# Suicide attempt/OD:  Per OSH records, pt OD on zyprexa and
adderall.  Seen by poison control at OSH - monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
were not noted.  Tox screen neg at OSH.  After extubation, she
was placed on CIWA scale and 1:1 sitter for possible alcoholism
and SI.  The patient was also evaluated by psych who recommended
d/cing 1:1 sitter and CIWA as pt was no longer suicidal and had
no previous ETOH abuse.  Pt was also started on Remeron per
psych recs.  On discharge from unit, pt was not suicidal and
although admits depression and anxiety.
.
# FEN:  Started TFs w/ nutrition recs while intubated.  Once
extubated, started po diet as tolerated. Repleted lytes K to 4
and mag to 2.
.
# PPX:  SC heparin, lansoprazole, colace
.
# Code status:  Full
.
Patient was discharged from the ICU onto the floor and remained
without a sitter. Since she was not exhibiting signs of SI to
the psych service, SW or to us, it was felt that reinstituting a
sitter would be seen as punitive. During her stay, patient
expressed remorse for her suicide attempt and plans for
restarting her life. Psychiatry felt that the patient was safe
to discharge home with her attending a day program at [**Hospital 882**]
hospital and in addition to having regular meetings with her
therapist, which she agreed to and was arranged. In addition,
she was discharged with a crisis plan in place which was
explained to the patient.
.
She was continued on IV oxacillin and was changed to Levofloacin
on discharge - since her bacteremia was also succeptible to this
antibiotics. She was prescribed enough Levoquin until [**4-2**] (end
of 14 day course of total antibiotics). She did not spike any
fevers while on the floor and surveillance blood cultures were
negative from [**3-20**] and [**3-22**]. Follow up urine cultures were also
negative.
.
Patient's BP remained in the 80s-90s for much of her stay on the
floor making it difficult to add on BB and ACE-I. On discharge,
her SBP rose to 108. Hence low dose metoprolol was initiated.
She was on ASA on the floor. 20mg lipitor was started on
discharge. (Lipid panel showed LDL of 54 and HDL of 43)
.
During her stay on the floor, she was walked with PT and her
oxygen requirements were weaned down slowly; on discharge
patient was completely off of oxygen and was comfortable. Repeat
CXR on [**3-26**] showed resolution of her pulmonary edema. She
finished a 5 day course of steroids for putative bronchospasm in
the hospital and was maintained on nebulizers.
------
Outstanding issues:
- Patient would likely benefit from starting an ACE-I as an
outpatient.
- Patient was on adderall and topamax as outpatient; these were
discontinued and will not be restarted; In particular, the
adderall may have played a significant part in the drastic
weight loss that the patient has experienced over the past year.

In addition, patient will need basic oncologic screening - in
particular, her pulmonary nodule will need follow up - per
Radiology here at [**Hospital1 **], it was recommended that this nodule be
followed up in [**3-12**] months with repeat CT.
- For her depressed EF, she will need a follow up ECHO,
particularly in the event that she may have a depressed EF due
to myocardial stress

Imaging:
[**2108-3-19**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe pulmonary opacity, likely representing
aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-19**] Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA, LAD that had mild 30% mid vessel lesion, LCx that
was
without obstructive disease and the RCA had a mid vessel 60%
lesion.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed low normal RAp, elevated PaP
with
marked respiratory variation and normal PCWP. The CI was 2.4.
There was
systemic hypotension with narrow pulse pressure. This was
consistent
with septic shock.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
.
[**2108-3-20**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to extensive apical
akinesis, with contractile function improving toward the base of
the heart. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2108-3-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of pulmonary
edema. Interval improvement of bibasilar opacities, which may
represent residual changes from aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-22**]: CT Chest with Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation worrisome for multifocal
pneumonia. Given the distribution, aspiration is also a
consideration. Followup after an appropriate clinical interval
post-treatment is recommended to demonstrate complete
resolution.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, and interlobular septal
thickening that may suggest fluid overload.
3. 3 mm nodule in the right lower lobe. In the absence of known
primary malignancy, followup in twelve months may be performed,
in the presence of known primary malignancy, followup in three
months is recommended.
.
[**2108-3-26**]: CXR:
There has been interval extubation and removal of the
nasogastric tube. A right PICC line terminates in the lower
superior vena cava. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within
normal limits. There are bibasilar areas of increased opacity
adjacent to small-to-moderate pleural effusions. The left lower
lobe opacity is slightly improved in the interval. The right
basilar opacity is difficult to compare due to the increasing
effusion and differences in positioning of the patient.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar consolidation in keeping with history of
aspiration pneumonia with interval improvement in left
retrocardiac area. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:  Patient is 59 yo woman without known cardiac
history, presented to OSH with suicide attempt o/d on zyprexa
and adderall, now intubated w/ pna and course c/b NSTEMI.
.
# Aspiration PNA/MSSA sepsis:  The patient was started on levo
([**3-19**]) at admission and then added vanc the following day.  Her
sputum and Bcx (1 out of 4) from admission grew out MSSA.  The
patient finished 7 day course of levoquin (750mg/day) on [**3-25**]
and was switched to oxacillin on [**3-25**] as BCX came back as MSSA.
The patient will finish 14 day course oxacillin on [**4-2**].  She
was on levophed for septic shock and has been off for >36hours
with SBP in high 80s-100s prior to call-out to the floor.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was initially intubated for airway
protection after found unresponsive and subsequently found to
have bilateral pneumonia thought to be [**2-9**] aspiration.  The
patient was extubated on [**3-23**] and has required high O2, so
empirically started short-course prednisone (5days) for presumed
COPD exacerbation on [**3-25**].
.
# Cardiac:
A. Ischemia:  Patient with flat troponins on initial
presentation to OSH, then trended up.  No history of CAD and per
OSH records, had recent cardiac w/u which was negative.  EKG on
initial presentation to OSH demonstrates diffuse ST elevation
and PR depression.  EKG on day of transfer demonstrates
anterolateral ST elevation with reciprical inferior changes.  Pt
went to cath on night of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**3-19**]) that
demonstrated no significant CAD (30% LAD, 60% RCA), more septic
physiology.  The patient was started on ASA.  Due to
hypotension, carvedilol was started but never given.  Lipitor
was not started as cholesterol was low.
.
B. Pump:  Patient appears clinically euvolemia, no hx of CHF.
ECHO [**3-20**] demonstrated LV systolic dysfxn with EF 20-30% [**2-9**]
extensive apical akinesis, also 3+ MR.  This was thought to be
stress-induced cardiomyopathy.  Will need a BB and ACEI once BP
stable and as BP tolerates.  The patient has been auto-diuresing
without needing lasix for all the fluid she received for sepsis.

.
C. Rhythm:  Was in sinus tachy on presentation, now in NSR.  No
prolongation of intervals on EKG.
.
# Suicide attempt/OD:  Per OSH records, pt OD on zyprexa and
adderall.  Seen by poison control at OSH - monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
were not noted.  Tox screen neg at OSH.  After extubation, she
was placed on CIWA scale and 1:1 sitter for possible alcoholism
and SI.  The patient was also evaluated by psych who recommended
d/cing 1:1 sitter and CIWA as pt was no longer suicidal and had
no previous ETOH abuse.  Pt was also started on Remeron per
psych recs.  On discharge from unit, pt was not suicidal and
although admits depression and anxiety.
.
# FEN:  Started TFs w/ nutrition recs while intubated.  Once
extubated, started po diet as tolerated. Repleted lytes K to 4
and mag to 2.
.
# PPX:  SC heparin, lansoprazole, colace
.
# Code status:  Full
.
Patient was discharged from the ICU onto the floor and remained
without a sitter. Since she was not exhibiting signs of SI to
the psych service, SW or to us, it was felt that reinstituting a
sitter would be seen as punitive. During her stay, patient
expressed remorse for her suicide attempt and plans for
restarting her life. Psychiatry felt that the patient was safe
to discharge home with her attending a day program at [**Hospital 882**]
hospital and in addition to having regular meetings with her
therapist, which she agreed to and was arranged. In addition,
she was discharged with a crisis plan in place which was
explained to the patient.
.
She was continued on IV oxacillin and was changed to Levofloacin
on discharge - since her bacteremia was also succeptible to this
antibiotics. She was prescribed enough Levoquin until [**4-2**] (end
of 14 day course of total antibiotics). She did not spike any
fevers while on the floor and surveillance blood cultures were
negative from [**3-20**] and [**3-22**]. Follow up urine cultures were also
negative.
.
Patient's BP remained in the 80s-90s for much of her stay on the
floor making it difficult to add on BB and ACE-I. On discharge,
her SBP rose to 108. Hence low dose metoprolol was initiated.
She was on ASA on the floor. 20mg lipitor was started on
discharge. (Lipid panel showed LDL of 54 and HDL of 43)
.
During her stay on the floor, she was walked with PT and her
oxygen requirements were weaned down slowly; on discharge
patient was completely off of oxygen and was comfortable. Repeat
CXR on [**3-26**] showed resolution of her pulmonary edema. She
finished a 5 day course of steroids for putative bronchospasm in
the hospital and was maintained on nebulizers.
------
Outstanding issues:
- Patient would likely benefit from starting an ACE-I as an
outpatient.
- Patient was on adderall and topamax as outpatient; these were
discontinued and will not be restarted; In particular, the
adderall may have played a significant part in the drastic
weight loss that the patient has experienced over the past year.

In addition, patient will need basic oncologic screening - in
particular, her pulmonary nodule will need follow up - per
Radiology here at [**Hospital1 **], it was recommended that this nodule be
followed up in [**3-12**] months with repeat CT.
- For her depressed EF, she will need a follow up ECHO,
particularly in the event that she may have a depressed EF due
to myocardial stress

PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 59 yo woman with PMH severe depression, migraine
has, recent weight loss w/ negative work up who presents from
[**Hospital3 **] today after suicide attempt, c/b NSTEMI.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2108-3-18**] after
overdosing on pills.  She apparently called her grandson stating
that she had taken ""45 pills"".  On evaluation of her pill
bottles, it appears as though she took Zyprexa and Adderall.
She was found minimally responsive by her husband at 2pm on
[**2108-3-18**] who called EMS.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 **], patient was intubated, given charcoal and
NG lavage, and admitted to ICU for managment.  On admission, pt
was noted to be tachycardic, but vital signs otherwise stable.
Labs were essentially WNL.  Tox screen was negative for benzos,
cocaine, tricyclics, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, asa,
small amt + of tylenol at 1.7.  Initial EKG demonstrated sinus
tachycardia at [**Street Address(2) 65762**] depressions in V1 and diffuse ST
elevations with PR depressions.  In terms of her overdose,
poison control was contact[**Name (NI) **] and patient was monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
was of concern with her Zyprexa overdose, but did not exhibit
any of these signs.  She was otherwise maintained with
supportive care.
Patient was also noted to have Troponin trend from 0.09 night of
admission to 0.03 to 4.5.  EKG on 2nd day of hospitalization
demonstrated ST elevations in lateral leads which were more
pronounced than on admission.  Patient was not placed on heparin
gtt as it was believed that this troponin elevation was more
likely [**2-9**] strain, as patient had had recent cardiac w/u as
outpt that was negative.
Hospital course otherwise notable for some hypoxia with
borderline O2 sats on 100% FiO2- CXR at that time demonstrated
some evidence of aspiration pna and ?CHF.  Pt's WBC also rose to
16.  Patient was therefore started on unasyn for broad spectrum
coverage.  Patient also developed hypotension, thought ?[**2-9**] pna,
and pt was placed transiently on neosynephrine for BP control,
although was off pressors on transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for managment of her
MI and her pulmonary status.
Currently patient is intubated and sedated.

Past Medical History:
(per OSH records):
1.) Depression
2.) Migraine HA

Had recent scan that demonstrated increase in size of LUL nodule
from 3mm->7mm, PET scan in [**12-11**] negative - scheduled to have
repeat Chest CT this month.

Imaging:
[**2108-3-19**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe pulmonary opacity, likely representing
aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-19**] Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA, LAD that had mild 30% mid vessel lesion, LCx that
was
without obstructive disease and the RCA had a mid vessel 60%
lesion.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed low normal RAp, elevated PaP
with
marked respiratory variation and normal PCWP. The CI was 2.4.
There was
systemic hypotension with narrow pulse pressure. This was
consistent
with septic shock.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
.
[**2108-3-20**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to extensive apical
akinesis, with contractile function improving toward the base of
the heart. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2108-3-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of pulmonary
edema. Interval improvement of bibasilar opacities, which may
represent residual changes from aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-22**]: CT Chest with Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation worrisome for multifocal
pneumonia. Given the distribution, aspiration is also a
consideration. Followup after an appropriate clinical interval
post-treatment is recommended to demonstrate complete
resolution.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, and interlobular septal
thickening that may suggest fluid overload.
3. 3 mm nodule in the right lower lobe. In the absence of known
primary malignancy, followup in twelve months may be performed,
in the presence of known primary malignancy, followup in three
months is recommended.
.
[**2108-3-26**]: CXR:
There has been interval extubation and removal of the
nasogastric tube. A right PICC line terminates in the lower
superior vena cava. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within
normal limits. There are bibasilar areas of increased opacity
adjacent to small-to-moderate pleural effusions. The left lower
lobe opacity is slightly improved in the interval. The right
basilar opacity is difficult to compare due to the increasing
effusion and differences in positioning of the patient.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar consolidation in keeping with history of
aspiration pneumonia with interval improvement in left
retrocardiac area. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:  Patient is 59 yo woman without known cardiac
history, presented to OSH with suicide attempt o/d on zyprexa
and adderall, now intubated w/ pna and course c/b NSTEMI.
.
# Aspiration PNA/MSSA sepsis:  The patient was started on levo
([**3-19**]) at admission and then added vanc the following day.  Her
sputum and Bcx (1 out of 4) from admission grew out MSSA.  The
patient finished 7 day course of levoquin (750mg/day) on [**3-25**]
and was switched to oxacillin on [**3-25**] as BCX came back as MSSA.
The patient will finish 14 day course oxacillin on [**4-2**].  She
was on levophed for septic shock and has been off for >36hours
with SBP in high 80s-100s prior to call-out to the floor.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was initially intubated for airway
protection after found unresponsive and subsequently found to
have bilateral pneumonia thought to be [**2-9**] aspiration.  The
patient was extubated on [**3-23**] and has required high O2, so
empirically started short-course prednisone (5days) for presumed
COPD exacerbation on [**3-25**].
.
# Cardiac:
A. Ischemia:  Patient with flat troponins on initial
presentation to OSH, then trended up.  No history of CAD and per
OSH records, had recent cardiac w/u which was negative.  EKG on
initial presentation to OSH demonstrates diffuse ST elevation
and PR depression.  EKG on day of transfer demonstrates
anterolateral ST elevation with reciprical inferior changes.  Pt
went to cath on night of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**3-19**]) that
demonstrated no significant CAD (30% LAD, 60% RCA), more septic
physiology.  The patient was started on ASA.  Due to
hypotension, carvedilol was started but never given.  Lipitor
was not started as cholesterol was low.
.
B. Pump:  Patient appears clinically euvolemia, no hx of CHF.
ECHO [**3-20**] demonstrated LV systolic dysfxn with EF 20-30% [**2-9**]
extensive apical akinesis, also 3+ MR.  This was thought to be
stress-induced cardiomyopathy.  Will need a BB and ACEI once BP
stable and as BP tolerates.  The patient has been auto-diuresing
without needing lasix for all the fluid she received for sepsis.

.
C. Rhythm:  Was in sinus tachy on presentation, now in NSR.  No
prolongation of intervals on EKG.
.
# Suicide attempt/OD:  Per OSH records, pt OD on zyprexa and
adderall.  Seen by poison control at OSH - monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
were not noted.  Tox screen neg at OSH.  After extubation, she
was placed on CIWA scale and 1:1 sitter for possible alcoholism
and SI.  The patient was also evaluated by psych who recommended
d/cing 1:1 sitter and CIWA as pt was no longer suicidal and had
no previous ETOH abuse.  Pt was also started on Remeron per
psych recs.  On discharge from unit, pt was not suicidal and
although admits depression and anxiety.
.
# FEN:  Started TFs w/ nutrition recs while intubated.  Once
extubated, started po diet as tolerated. Repleted lytes K to 4
and mag to 2.
.
# PPX:  SC heparin, lansoprazole, colace
.
# Code status:  Full
.
Patient was discharged from the ICU onto the floor and remained
without a sitter. Since she was not exhibiting signs of SI to
the psych service, SW or to us, it was felt that reinstituting a
sitter would be seen as punitive. During her stay, patient
expressed remorse for her suicide attempt and plans for
restarting her life. Psychiatry felt that the patient was safe
to discharge home with her attending a day program at [**Hospital 882**]
hospital and in addition to having regular meetings with her
therapist, which she agreed to and was arranged. In addition,
she was discharged with a crisis plan in place which was
explained to the patient.
.
She was continued on IV oxacillin and was changed to Levofloacin
on discharge - since her bacteremia was also succeptible to this
antibiotics. She was prescribed enough Levoquin until [**4-2**] (end
of 14 day course of total antibiotics). She did not spike any
fevers while on the floor and surveillance blood cultures were
negative from [**3-20**] and [**3-22**]. Follow up urine cultures were also
negative.
.
Patient's BP remained in the 80s-90s for much of her stay on the
floor making it difficult to add on BB and ACE-I. On discharge,
her SBP rose to 108. Hence low dose metoprolol was initiated.
She was on ASA on the floor. 20mg lipitor was started on
discharge. (Lipid panel showed LDL of 54 and HDL of 43)
.
During her stay on the floor, she was walked with PT and her
oxygen requirements were weaned down slowly; on discharge
patient was completely off of oxygen and was comfortable. Repeat
CXR on [**3-26**] showed resolution of her pulmonary edema. She
finished a 5 day course of steroids for putative bronchospasm in
the hospital and was maintained on nebulizers.
------
Outstanding issues:
- Patient would likely benefit from starting an ACE-I as an
outpatient.
- Patient was on adderall and topamax as outpatient; these were
discontinued and will not be restarted; In particular, the
adderall may have played a significant part in the drastic
weight loss that the patient has experienced over the past year.

In addition, patient will need basic oncologic screening - in
particular, her pulmonary nodule will need follow up - per
Radiology here at [**Hospital1 **], it was recommended that this nodule be
followed up in [**3-12**] months with repeat CT.
- For her depressed EF, she will need a follow up ECHO,
particularly in the event that she may have a depressed EF due
to myocardial stress

PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 59 yo woman with PMH severe depression, migraine
has, recent weight loss w/ negative work up who presents from
[**Hospital3 **] today after suicide attempt, c/b NSTEMI.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2108-3-18**] after
overdosing on pills.  She apparently called her grandson stating
that she had taken ""45 pills"".  On evaluation of her pill
bottles, it appears as though she took Zyprexa and Adderall.
She was found minimally responsive by her husband at 2pm on
[**2108-3-18**] who called EMS.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 **], patient was intubated, given charcoal and
NG lavage, and admitted to ICU for managment.  On admission, pt
was noted to be tachycardic, but vital signs otherwise stable.
Labs were essentially WNL.  Tox screen was negative for benzos,
cocaine, tricyclics, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, asa,
small amt + of tylenol at 1.7.  Initial EKG demonstrated sinus
tachycardia at [**Street Address(2) 65762**] depressions in V1 and diffuse ST
elevations with PR depressions.  In terms of her overdose,
poison control was contact[**Name (NI) **] and patient was monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
was of concern with her Zyprexa overdose, but did not exhibit
any of these signs.  She was otherwise maintained with
supportive care.
Patient was also noted to have Troponin trend from 0.09 night of
admission to 0.03 to 4.5.  EKG on 2nd day of hospitalization
demonstrated ST elevations in lateral leads which were more
pronounced than on admission.  Patient was not placed on heparin
gtt as it was believed that this troponin elevation was more
likely [**2-9**] strain, as patient had had recent cardiac w/u as
outpt that was negative.
Hospital course otherwise notable for some hypoxia with
borderline O2 sats on 100% FiO2- CXR at that time demonstrated
some evidence of aspiration pna and ?CHF.  Pt's WBC also rose to
16.  Patient was therefore started on unasyn for broad spectrum
coverage.  Patient also developed hypotension, thought ?[**2-9**] pna,
and pt was placed transiently on neosynephrine for BP control,
although was off pressors on transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for managment of her
MI and her pulmonary status.
Currently patient is intubated and sedated.

Past Medical History:
(per OSH records):
1.) Depression
2.) Migraine HA
3.) Chronic pain
4.) 100 lb weight loss over past year - pt has undergone
extensive w/u including colonoscopy, GYN exam, HIV test, cardiac
w/u, stool studies, celiac studies negative.  Also had abd CT
negative, Chest CT demonstrated LUL nodule which was monitered.
Had recent scan that demonstrated increase in size of LUL nodule
from 3mm->7mm, PET scan in [**12-11**] negative - scheduled to have
repeat Chest CT this month.


Social History:
Patient is married, lives w/ husband and 14 [**Name2 (NI) **] grandson.  +
family stress due to death of her son from heroin overdose about
2 years ago.  Also has daughter w/ current substance abuse
problems.  Remote tobacco history.

Imaging:
[**2108-3-19**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe pulmonary opacity, likely representing
aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-19**] Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA, LAD that had mild 30% mid vessel lesion, LCx that
was
without obstructive disease and the RCA had a mid vessel 60%
lesion.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed low normal RAp, elevated PaP
with
marked respiratory variation and normal PCWP. The CI was 2.4.
There was
systemic hypotension with narrow pulse pressure. This was
consistent
with septic shock.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
.
[**2108-3-20**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to extensive apical
akinesis, with contractile function improving toward the base of
the heart. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2108-3-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of pulmonary
edema. Interval improvement of bibasilar opacities, which may
represent residual changes from aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-22**]: CT Chest with Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation worrisome for multifocal
pneumonia. Given the distribution, aspiration is also a
consideration. Followup after an appropriate clinical interval
post-treatment is recommended to demonstrate complete
resolution.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, and interlobular septal
thickening that may suggest fluid overload.
3. 3 mm nodule in the right lower lobe. In the absence of known
primary malignancy, followup in twelve months may be performed,
in the presence of known primary malignancy, followup in three
months is recommended.
.
[**2108-3-26**]: CXR:
There has been interval extubation and removal of the
nasogastric tube. A right PICC line terminates in the lower
superior vena cava. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within
normal limits. There are bibasilar areas of increased opacity
adjacent to small-to-moderate pleural effusions. The left lower
lobe opacity is slightly improved in the interval. The right
basilar opacity is difficult to compare due to the increasing
effusion and differences in positioning of the patient.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar consolidation in keeping with history of
aspiration pneumonia with interval improvement in left
retrocardiac area. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:  Patient is 59 yo woman without known cardiac
history, presented to OSH with suicide attempt o/d on zyprexa
and adderall, now intubated w/ pna and course c/b NSTEMI.
.
# Aspiration PNA/MSSA sepsis:  The patient was started on levo
([**3-19**]) at admission and then added vanc the following day.  Her
sputum and Bcx (1 out of 4) from admission grew out MSSA.  The
patient finished 7 day course of levoquin (750mg/day) on [**3-25**]
and was switched to oxacillin on [**3-25**] as BCX came back as MSSA.
The patient will finish 14 day course oxacillin on [**4-2**].  She
was on levophed for septic shock and has been off for >36hours
with SBP in high 80s-100s prior to call-out to the floor.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was initially intubated for airway
protection after found unresponsive and subsequently found to
have bilateral pneumonia thought to be [**2-9**] aspiration.  The
patient was extubated on [**3-23**] and has required high O2, so
empirically started short-course prednisone (5days) for presumed
COPD exacerbation on [**3-25**].
.
# Cardiac:
A. Ischemia:  Patient with flat troponins on initial
presentation to OSH, then trended up.  No history of CAD and per
OSH records, had recent cardiac w/u which was negative.  EKG on
initial presentation to OSH demonstrates diffuse ST elevation
and PR depression.  EKG on day of transfer demonstrates
anterolateral ST elevation with reciprical inferior changes.  Pt
went to cath on night of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**3-19**]) that
demonstrated no significant CAD (30% LAD, 60% RCA), more septic
physiology.  The patient was started on ASA.  Due to
hypotension, carvedilol was started but never given.  Lipitor
was not started as cholesterol was low.
.
B. Pump:  Patient appears clinically euvolemia, no hx of CHF.
ECHO [**3-20**] demonstrated LV systolic dysfxn with EF 20-30% [**2-9**]
extensive apical akinesis, also 3+ MR.  This was thought to be
stress-induced cardiomyopathy.  Will need a BB and ACEI once BP
stable and as BP tolerates.  The patient has been auto-diuresing
without needing lasix for all the fluid she received for sepsis.

.
C. Rhythm:  Was in sinus tachy on presentation, now in NSR.  No
prolongation of intervals on EKG.
.
# Suicide attempt/OD:  Per OSH records, pt OD on zyprexa and
adderall.  Seen by poison control at OSH - monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
were not noted.  Tox screen neg at OSH.  After extubation, she
was placed on CIWA scale and 1:1 sitter for possible alcoholism
and SI.  The patient was also evaluated by psych who recommended
d/cing 1:1 sitter and CIWA as pt was no longer suicidal and had
no previous ETOH abuse.  Pt was also started on Remeron per
psych recs.  On discharge from unit, pt was not suicidal and
although admits depression and anxiety.
.
# FEN:  Started TFs w/ nutrition recs while intubated.  Once
extubated, started po diet as tolerated. Repleted lytes K to 4
and mag to 2.
.
# PPX:  SC heparin, lansoprazole, colace
.
# Code status:  Full
.
Patient was discharged from the ICU onto the floor and remained
without a sitter. Since she was not exhibiting signs of SI to
the psych service, SW or to us, it was felt that reinstituting a
sitter would be seen as punitive. During her stay, patient
expressed remorse for her suicide attempt and plans for
restarting her life. Psychiatry felt that the patient was safe
to discharge home with her attending a day program at [**Hospital 882**]
hospital and in addition to having regular meetings with her
therapist, which she agreed to and was arranged. In addition,
she was discharged with a crisis plan in place which was
explained to the patient.
.
She was continued on IV oxacillin and was changed to Levofloacin
on discharge - since her bacteremia was also succeptible to this
antibiotics. She was prescribed enough Levoquin until [**4-2**] (end
of 14 day course of total antibiotics). She did not spike any
fevers while on the floor and surveillance blood cultures were
negative from [**3-20**] and [**3-22**]. Follow up urine cultures were also
negative.
.
Patient's BP remained in the 80s-90s for much of her stay on the
floor making it difficult to add on BB and ACE-I. On discharge,
her SBP rose to 108. Hence low dose metoprolol was initiated.
She was on ASA on the floor. 20mg lipitor was started on
discharge. (Lipid panel showed LDL of 54 and HDL of 43)
.
During her stay on the floor, she was walked with PT and her
oxygen requirements were weaned down slowly; on discharge
patient was completely off of oxygen and was comfortable. Repeat
CXR on [**3-26**] showed resolution of her pulmonary edema. She
finished a 5 day course of steroids for putative bronchospasm in
the hospital and was maintained on nebulizers.
------
Outstanding issues:
- Patient would likely benefit from starting an ACE-I as an
outpatient.
- Patient was on adderall and topamax as outpatient; these were
discontinued and will not be restarted; In particular, the
adderall may have played a significant part in the drastic
weight loss that the patient has experienced over the past year.

In addition, patient will need basic oncologic screening - in
particular, her pulmonary nodule will need follow up - per
Radiology here at [**Hospital1 **], it was recommended that this nodule be
followed up in [**3-12**] months with repeat CT.
- For her depressed EF, she will need a follow up ECHO,
particularly in the event that she may have a depressed EF due
to myocardial stress

PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 59 yo woman with PMH severe depression, migraine
has, recent weight loss w/ negative work up who presents from
[**Hospital3 **] today after suicide attempt, c/b NSTEMI.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2108-3-18**] after
overdosing on pills.  She apparently called her grandson stating
that she had taken ""45 pills"".  On evaluation of her pill
bottles, it appears as though she took Zyprexa and Adderall.
She was found minimally responsive by her husband at 2pm on
[**2108-3-18**] who called EMS.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 **], patient was intubated, given charcoal and
NG lavage, and admitted to ICU for managment.  On admission, pt
was noted to be tachycardic, but vital signs otherwise stable.
Labs were essentially WNL.  Tox screen was negative for benzos,
cocaine, tricyclics, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, asa,
small amt + of tylenol at 1.7.  Initial EKG demonstrated sinus
tachycardia at [**Street Address(2) 65762**] depressions in V1 and diffuse ST
elevations with PR depressions.  In terms of her overdose,
poison control was contact[**Name (NI) **] and patient was monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
was of concern with her Zyprexa overdose, but did not exhibit
any of these signs.  She was otherwise maintained with
supportive care.
Patient was also noted to have Troponin trend from 0.09 night of
admission to 0.03 to 4.5.  EKG on 2nd day of hospitalization
demonstrated ST elevations in lateral leads which were more
pronounced than on admission.  Patient was not placed on heparin
gtt as it was believed that this troponin elevation was more
likely [**2-9**] strain, as patient had had recent cardiac w/u as
outpt that was negative.
Hospital course otherwise notable for some hypoxia with
borderline O2 sats on 100% FiO2- CXR at that time demonstrated
some evidence of aspiration pna and ?CHF.  Pt's WBC also rose to
16.  Patient was therefore started on unasyn for broad spectrum
coverage.  Patient also developed hypotension, thought ?[**2-9**] pna,
and pt was placed transiently on neosynephrine for BP control,
although was off pressors on transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for managment of her
MI and her pulmonary status.
Currently patient is intubated and sedated.

Past Medical History:
(per OSH records):
1.) Depression
2.) Migraine HA
3.) Chronic pain
4.) 100 lb weight loss over past year - pt has undergone
extensive w/u including colonoscopy, GYN exam, HIV test, cardiac
w/u, stool studies, celiac studies negative.  Also had abd CT
negative, Chest CT demonstrated LUL nodule which was monitered.
Had recent scan that demonstrated increase in size of LUL nodule
from 3mm->7mm, PET scan in [**12-11**] negative - scheduled to have
repeat Chest CT this month.


Social History:
Patient is married, lives w/ husband and 14 [**Name2 (NI) **] grandson.  +
family stress due to death of her son from heroin overdose about
2 years ago.  Also has daughter w/ current substance abuse
problems.  Remote tobacco history.

Imaging:
[**2108-3-19**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe pulmonary opacity, likely representing
aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-19**] Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA, LAD that had mild 30% mid vessel lesion, LCx that
was
without obstructive disease and the RCA had a mid vessel 60%
lesion.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed low normal RAp, elevated PaP
with
marked respiratory variation and normal PCWP. The CI was 2.4.
There was
systemic hypotension with narrow pulse pressure. This was
consistent
with septic shock.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
.
[**2108-3-20**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to extensive apical
akinesis, with contractile function improving toward the base of
the heart. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2108-3-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of pulmonary
edema. Interval improvement of bibasilar opacities, which may
represent residual changes from aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-22**]: CT Chest with Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation worrisome for multifocal
pneumonia. Given the distribution, aspiration is also a
consideration. Followup after an appropriate clinical interval
post-treatment is recommended to demonstrate complete
resolution.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, and interlobular septal
thickening that may suggest fluid overload.
3. 3 mm nodule in the right lower lobe. In the absence of known
primary malignancy, followup in twelve months may be performed,
in the presence of known primary malignancy, followup in three
months is recommended.
.
[**2108-3-26**]: CXR:
There has been interval extubation and removal of the
nasogastric tube. A right PICC line terminates in the lower
superior vena cava. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within
normal limits. There are bibasilar areas of increased opacity
adjacent to small-to-moderate pleural effusions. The left lower
lobe opacity is slightly improved in the interval. The right
basilar opacity is difficult to compare due to the increasing
effusion and differences in positioning of the patient.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar consolidation in keeping with history of
aspiration pneumonia with interval improvement in left
retrocardiac area. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:  Patient is 59 yo woman without known cardiac
history, presented to OSH with suicide attempt o/d on zyprexa
and adderall, now intubated w/ pna and course c/b NSTEMI.
.
# Aspiration PNA/MSSA sepsis:  The patient was started on levo
([**3-19**]) at admission and then added vanc the following day.  Her
sputum and Bcx (1 out of 4) from admission grew out MSSA.  The
patient finished 7 day course of levoquin (750mg/day) on [**3-25**]
and was switched to oxacillin on [**3-25**] as BCX came back as MSSA.
The patient will finish 14 day course oxacillin on [**4-2**].  She
was on levophed for septic shock and has been off for >36hours
with SBP in high 80s-100s prior to call-out to the floor.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was initially intubated for airway
protection after found unresponsive and subsequently found to
have bilateral pneumonia thought to be [**2-9**] aspiration.  The
patient was extubated on [**3-23**] and has required high O2, so
empirically started short-course prednisone (5days) for presumed
COPD exacerbation on [**3-25**].
.
# Cardiac:
A. Ischemia:  Patient with flat troponins on initial
presentation to OSH, then trended up.  No history of CAD and per
OSH records, had recent cardiac w/u which was negative.  EKG on
initial presentation to OSH demonstrates diffuse ST elevation
and PR depression.  EKG on day of transfer demonstrates
anterolateral ST elevation with reciprical inferior changes.  Pt
went to cath on night of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**3-19**]) that
demonstrated no significant CAD (30% LAD, 60% RCA), more septic
physiology.  The patient was started on ASA.  Due to
hypotension, carvedilol was started but never given.  Lipitor
was not started as cholesterol was low.
.
B. Pump:  Patient appears clinically euvolemia, no hx of CHF.
ECHO [**3-20**] demonstrated LV systolic dysfxn with EF 20-30% [**2-9**]
extensive apical akinesis, also 3+ MR.  This was thought to be
stress-induced cardiomyopathy.  Will need a BB and ACEI once BP
stable and as BP tolerates.  The patient has been auto-diuresing
without needing lasix for all the fluid she received for sepsis.

.
C. Rhythm:  Was in sinus tachy on presentation, now in NSR.  No
prolongation of intervals on EKG.
.
# Suicide attempt/OD:  Per OSH records, pt OD on zyprexa and
adderall.  Seen by poison control at OSH - monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
were not noted.  Tox screen neg at OSH.  After extubation, she
was placed on CIWA scale and 1:1 sitter for possible alcoholism
and SI.  The patient was also evaluated by psych who recommended
d/cing 1:1 sitter and CIWA as pt was no longer suicidal and had
no previous ETOH abuse.  Pt was also started on Remeron per
psych recs.  On discharge from unit, pt was not suicidal and
although admits depression and anxiety.
.
# FEN:  Started TFs w/ nutrition recs while intubated.  Once
extubated, started po diet as tolerated. Repleted lytes K to 4
and mag to 2.
.
# PPX:  SC heparin, lansoprazole, colace
.
# Code status:  Full
.
Patient was discharged from the ICU onto the floor and remained
without a sitter. Since she was not exhibiting signs of SI to
the psych service, SW or to us, it was felt that reinstituting a
sitter would be seen as punitive. During her stay, patient
expressed remorse for her suicide attempt and plans for
restarting her life. Psychiatry felt that the patient was safe
to discharge home with her attending a day program at [**Hospital 882**]
hospital and in addition to having regular meetings with her
therapist, which she agreed to and was arranged. In addition,
she was discharged with a crisis plan in place which was
explained to the patient.
.
She was continued on IV oxacillin and was changed to Levofloacin
on discharge - since her bacteremia was also succeptible to this
antibiotics. She was prescribed enough Levoquin until [**4-2**] (end
of 14 day course of total antibiotics). She did not spike any
fevers while on the floor and surveillance blood cultures were
negative from [**3-20**] and [**3-22**]. Follow up urine cultures were also
negative.
.
Patient's BP remained in the 80s-90s for much of her stay on the
floor making it difficult to add on BB and ACE-I. On discharge,
her SBP rose to 108. Hence low dose metoprolol was initiated.
She was on ASA on the floor. 20mg lipitor was started on
discharge. (Lipid panel showed LDL of 54 and HDL of 43)
.
During her stay on the floor, she was walked with PT and her
oxygen requirements were weaned down slowly; on discharge
patient was completely off of oxygen and was comfortable. Repeat
CXR on [**3-26**] showed resolution of her pulmonary edema. She
finished a 5 day course of steroids for putative bronchospasm in
the hospital and was maintained on nebulizers.
------
Outstanding issues:
- Patient would likely benefit from starting an ACE-I as an
outpatient.
- Patient was on adderall and topamax as outpatient; these were
discontinued and will not be restarted; In particular, the
adderall may have played a significant part in the drastic
weight loss that the patient has experienced over the past year.

In addition, patient will need basic oncologic screening - in
particular, her pulmonary nodule will need follow up - per
Radiology here at [**Hospital1 **], it was recommended that this nodule be
followed up in [**3-12**] months with repeat CT.
- For her depressed EF, she will need a follow up ECHO,
particularly in the event that she may have a depressed EF due
to myocardial stress
