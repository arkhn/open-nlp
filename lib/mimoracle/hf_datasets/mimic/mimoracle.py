    abstract = {Machine learning for healthcare researchers face challenges to
    progress and reproducibility due to a lack of standardized processing
    frameworks for public datasets. We present MIMIC-Extract, an open source pipeline
    for transforming the raw electronic health record (EHR) data of critical care
    patients from the publicly-available MIMIC-III database into data structures that are directly
    usable in common time-series prediction pipelines. MIMIC-Extract addresses three challenges
    in making complex EHR data accessible to the broader machine learning community.
    First, MIMIC-Extract transforms raw vital sign and laboratory measurements into usable hourly
    time series, performing essential steps such as unit conversion, outlier handling,
    and aggregation of semantically similar features to reduce missingness and improve robustness.
    Second, MIMIC-Extract extracts and makes prediction of clinically-relevant targets possible,
    including outcomes such as mortality and length-of-stay
    as well as comprehensive hourly intervention signals for ventilators, vasopressors,
    and fluid therapies. Finally, the pipeline emphasizes reproducibility and
    extensibility to future research questions. We demonstrate the pipeline's effectiveness
    by developing several benchmark tasks for outcome and intervention forecasting and
    assessing the performance of competitive models.},
