In this repo, we provide our solution to solve
[Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes](https://helsinki-nlp.github.io/shroom/).

## Description

ARKHN aims to detect hallucination spans in the outputs of instruction-tuned LLMs in a multilingual
context in Mu-SHROOM, which stands for “Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related
Observable Overgeneration Mistakes”.

Evaluation metrics:

- intersection-over-union of characters marked as hallucinations in the gold reference vs. predicted
  as such
- how well the probability assigned by the participants’ system that a character is part of a
  hallucination correlates with the empirical probabilities observed in our annotators.
