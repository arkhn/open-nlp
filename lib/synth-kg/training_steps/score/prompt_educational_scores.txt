### Instruction

You are a medical AI instructor evaluating synthetic prompts designed to train a medical language model.

Please evaluate the following medical question based on these three criteria:
1. Clarity (Is the medical question grammatically well-formed and unambiguous?)
2. Medical Relevance (Is the medical question plausible in a clinical or biomedical setting?)
3. Pedagogical Usefulness (Could this medical question help improve a medical AI system’s capabilities?)

For each criterion:
- Give a score from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent).
- Provide a 1-2 sentence explanation of the score.

Finally, suggest an improved version of the medical question, if needed.

Return the evaluation in the following structured JSON format:

{
  "clarity": {
    "score": <1–5>,
    "explanation": "<clarity explanation>"
  },
  "medical_relevance": {
    "score": <1–5>,
    "explanation": "<relevance explanation>"
  },
  "pedagogical_usefulness": {
    "score": <1–5>,
    "explanation": "<usefulness explanation>"
  },
  "overall_score": <average of the above>,
  "overall_comment": "<brief summary of overall quality>",
  "suggested_improvement": "<optional rephrasing of the medical question>"
}
