It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear you're experiencing these symptoms. Your description suggests that you might have had orchitis, which is inflammation of one or both testes and common in people who get mumps after puberty. Orchitis can indeed result in a decrease in testicle size and potential fertility issues.\n\nWhile it's difficult to definitely say without an examination, the persistence of your symptoms does indicate there may be ongoing issues or complications like chronic epididymitis (inflammation of the tube at the back of the testicle).\n\nIt is essential for you to see a urologist as soon as possible for further evaluation and management. They can perform ultrasound imaging studies or other tests to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment. Avoiding sexual activity till you visit and receive advice from the doctor would also be prudent.\n\nAs for antibiotics, it's best not to self-medicate as this requires a prescription based on a thorough assessment of infection type, severity and your overall health status. An inappropriate antibiotic usage could lead to resistance and make any lingering infection more difficult to treat.\n\nPlease schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider or urologist immediately to address these concerns.\n\n## Output (b):\n I will take down your request and pass it on to the right specialist.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nCocaine generally leaves the body within a few days. It is normally not detectable in blood or saliva tests after 1 to 2 days, and in urine tests it can be detected up to 3 days, but this can extend to about two weeks with heavy use. The half-life of cocaine is relatively short, about 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\n\nIn terms of impact on sperm, cocaine has been found to cause abnormalities in sperm shape, number, and movement, which could potentially affect fertility. There isn't a specific time frame linked to how long cocaine stays in sperm, as such effects depend on individual metabolism and frequency of use.\n\nWhile there aren't definitive guidelines for this situation, it's generally recommended for couples trying to conceive to avoid illicit drugs altogether, because of potential harm to both prospective parents and the potential child. It is advisable to seek further advice from your own healthcare provider who knows your personal circumstances.\n\nIt's also important to consider lifestyle choices that promote healthy fertility. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity, and abstaining from alcohol, tobacco and other harmful substances can all help improve fertility outcomes.\n\nYou should share this information with your healthcare provider so they can provide you with accurate guidance based on their knowledge of your overall health condition.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n I will be asking the questions and taking notes, but the doctor will be providing the answers and making recommendations. Can you tell me a little bit more about the patient's history and what they have been doing to try to get pregnant, and how long they have been trying? Does cocaine affect fertility, and if so, how long does it take to clear from the system, and what are the chances of it affecting the pregnancy if we do manage to get pregnant, and how long will we

I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like you're experiencing breakthrough bleeding, which can occur when the hormonal levels in your body fluctuate. When on oral contraceptives like Yaz, skipping sugar pills and prolonging the time before having a period can potentially lead to irregularities including breakthrough bleeding or spotting.\n\nThe brown discharge is likely old blood that didn't fully exit during your period. If it doesn't clear up within a few days to a week, or if you notice other symptoms like an unusual vaginal odor, itchiness, burning sensation, or pelvic pain, contact your healthcare provider as there could be another issue, such as infection or inflammation.\n\nAs for the bleeding during sex, this could also be related to breakthrough bleeding or might indicate cervical irritation. It should subside with your next menstrual cycle. Still, recurrent or heavy bleeding during sex warrants medical attention to rule out more serious conditions like polyps, infection, or rarely, cervical cancer.\n\nIf these conditions persist or cause concern, it would be best to consult with your healthcare provider who might want to adjust your contraceptive regimen or investigate other causes behind these symptoms. \n\nKeep in mind, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with your doctor for appropriate examinations, treatment, testing, and care recommendations.\n\n## Output (b):\n Can you also provide some information about your overall health and any other medications you are taking, including the Yaz pill, to better understand your situation and provide the best answer to your question?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am now very worried what good precautions should I take with him. Can you suggest me what should I do?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour son has a high degree of myopia (nearsightedness), which means he can see things clearly that are close, but things in the distance will look blurred. This condition is fairly common and manageable with corrective measures like glasses or contact lenses. Some precautions and steps you can take include:\n\n1. Regular Eye Check-ups: Ensure he gets regular eye checkups so that any worsening of his myopia can be detected early.\n\n2. Corrective Lenses: Be consistent with use of prescribed eyeglasses or contact lenses. Take care to replace them as advised by the optometrist if your son's prescription changes.\n\n3. Monitor Screen Time: Limit the time spent on digital devices given that excessive screen time can strain eyes and contribute to progressive myopia. Encourage him to take frequent breaks using the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\n\n4. Encourage Outdoor Activities: Increase outdoor activities, as studies have indicated they could slow down the progression of myopia.\n\n5. Good Lighting: Make sure he always reads and writes under good light conditions to limit the strain on his eyes. \n\n6. Healthy Diet: Nurture a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which are beneficial for eye health.\n\n7. Posture: Teach him the correct posture while reading or writing to avoid unnecessary strain on the eyes and body.\n\nThese precautions can help manage your son's condition.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe lump you are describing could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. Postoperative Swelling: After an extraction or a surgical procedure, swelling of the surrounding tissues is common and can sometimes feel like a hard lump. This should subside as the healing progresses.\n \n2. Abscess/Infection: Although not as common since you're already taking Amoxicillin, which is an antibiotic, it's possible that there could have been an infection forming around the extraction site causing this lumpy feel.\n\n3. Bone Spurring: Sometimes after extractions, small sharp pieces of bone can push their way out from the extraction site. These are usually normal, but can feel like a hard lump until they either come fully out or resorb into the body.\n\nGiven that the lower wisdom tooth was removed only six days ago, swelling in the area is still quite normal, especially if the procedure was complex due to the close proximity to the nerve. However, if the swelling doesn't subside, becomes notably worse, or if you develop other signs of infection like fever or intense pain, it is very important to contact your surgeon right away.\n\nAs always, although these are general guidelines, nothing beats a physical examination in person. Therefore, I would advise you to discuss your concern with your oral surgeon. Ensure to maintain good oral hygiene and follow all post-operative instructions given by your dentist. Don't forget to rinse your mouth with warm salt water 2-3 times per day, which can help reduce inflammation\n\n## Output (b):\n I'm the assistant, can you tell me more about the procedure and what the doctor discussed regarding the removal and recovery?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

It was my first intercourse with a sex worker and I am worrying about expose to HIV. I have started fearing from the minute where I had broken condom intercourse and she said to me that she does not have HIV and they never allow anyone to have sex without a condom because of fear of getting infected. So there is no need to worry but I cannot believe her and started studying about HIV and its symptoms and I have a feeling of infection because I got red dots in my finger pits and cold and throat infection.I want to know what are the red dots on my finger which I got? I got it tested many times in those three months and got a negative result. I am worrying abt six months test.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYou are right to be cautious, as unprotected sex does put you at a higher risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. It's good that you've been testing regularly and currently have negative results.\n\nThe little red spots on your fingers may not necessarily be related to HIV. They could be caused by many things like dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, allergies, or even stress. However, it would be difficult for me to confirm without physically seeing them. You should consult with a dermatologist if these dots persist or develop further symptoms.\n\nCold and throat infection can also come from common viruses and not necessarily linked to HIV. If tested negative multiple times within the three-month window period, it is very likely you are HIV-negative. Current tests are extremely accurate at this point.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that few type of HIV tests will need six months time to detect antibodies. Hence, it is advised to get tested after 6 months as per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation. It's important that you continue to protect yourself moving forward. Your sexual health is crucial so always use protection to reduce the risk of STI transmission. \n\nWhatever the circumstances, you should see your healthcare provider to discuss about your symptoms and concerns. Anytime you engage in high-risk behavior and concerns arise - seek medical help immediately.\n\nRemember that there are medications available called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which can drastically reduce the chance of contracting HIV if started within\n\n## Output (b):\n I will take down your question and answer it later.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on the results of your CT scan, it seems like your situation is under control. The small size of these nodules (3 mm and 4 mm), as well as their non-aggressive appearance on imaging, strongly suggest they are benign (non-cancerous). Intrathoracic nodules, such as intrapulmonary lymph nodes or lung nodules, can appear for many reasons other than cancer, including infection, inflammation, or even normal anatomic variations.\n\nThe finding of \"mild thymic hyperplasia\" also suggests a non-malignant process; the thymus sometimes enlarges in response to stress, illness, or normal hormonal changes depending on age.\n\nWhile it's completely understandable that you might find this concerning, at this stage, the appropriate course of action usually involves monitoring rather than aggressive treatment. This would typically involve follow-up CT scans at intervals recommended by a radiologist or pulmonologist to ensure there's no significant growth or change in these nodules.\n\nHowever, remember, this advice is based on limited information and should not replace the advice of your own physicians who have full access to your medical records. Stick with your doctors' plan, but don\u2019t hesitate to ask them more questions if you\u2019re feeling unsure about anything.\n\n## Output (b):\n I will answer the question, but I need to consult with the doctor about the medical advice.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThere are various reasons why your period might be late other than pregnancy. Stress and anxiety can cause changes in your menstrual cycle. Excessive exercise, rapid weight loss or gain, hormonal issues like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid dysfunction can also make your periods irregular. Certain medications including contraceptive pills can alter your cycle too.\n\nSometimes having sex for the first time may induce stress or fear of being pregnant which can result in a delayed period even if you had the negative pregnancy test.\n\nHowever, if this continues to be an issue, it would be best to follow up with your gynecologist for further evaluation. Also, consider using reliable contraception methods if you wish to avoid unwanted pregnancies.\n\n## Output (b):\n Can you also provide some assistance with the patient records, and perhaps we can review them to better understand the patient's condition.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nPhenol, also known as carbolic acid, is a corrosive substance which can cause harm if ingested or in contact with skin. Based on the symptoms your friend has shown (vomiting), it indicates that phenol could have affected his gastrointestinal tract.\n\nContinued symptoms to watch for would include abdominal pain, diarrhea, burns or blisters around the mouth, difficulty swallowing/breathing, dizziness/fainting, and changes in heart rate. Skin exposure can also result in burns, so clean any areas that might've come into contact with phenol with mild soap and water.\n\nThe actions taken so far (vomiting and drinking lots of salty water) in an attempt to mitigate the effects are not recommended without medical supervision since they bring about their own potential risks such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. \n\nAt this point due to the potential severity of phenol poisoning, I highly recommend seeking immediate emergency medical attention even though he vomited after ingestion. Try to give specific information about the amount consumed and response so far accurately to the healthcare providers. After all, \"phenol\" contains a host of substances, all of which may have different treatment recommendations. It is essential for these facts to be relayed quickly for appropriate therapy to be commenced urgently.\n\n## Output (b):\n I'll take care of the questions, but you should consult a specialist.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

It is never at night or during the day. It can happen more than once sometimes. If I move, roll over, or get up, I can make it stop. It does not hurt and is very fast. What does this sound like?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe symptoms you describe could potentially suggest a neurological issue, perhaps related to pressure changes or blood flow to your brain when you change position. However, it's also possible that it's just a benign sensation that doesn't indicate any underlying problem. Any numbness in the face, though, should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. You might be referred to a neurologist for further evaluation, as conditions like migraines, seizures, transient ischemic attacks can present with such symptoms but they are typically associated with other symptoms too. \n\nHowever, without more information and without conducting a thorough examination, it's impossible to provide a definite answer. Please make an appointment with your doctor soon to discuss your symptoms in detail.\n\n## Output (b):\n I think we should take a closer look.

Last week I had brown discharge with mild lower abdominal pain and was prescribed Susten 200 mg (oral). Now, I am feeling the pain frequently in the right lower abdomen with mild bleeding and pain. It is less when I lie on bed. What to do?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms of abdominal pain, mild bleeding, and a recent ultrasound without visible fetal or yolk sac could potentially be suggestive of an early pregnancy complication such as threatened miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy especially should be ruled out due to right lower abdominal pain; it is a condition where the fetus begins to develop outside the uterus, often in a fallopian tube. \n\nWhile Susten 200mg (progesterone) may be administered for threatened abortion or to support early pregnancy, it doesn't eliminate risk completely and not effective against ectopic pregnancies.\n\nThis requires immediate medical attention. You need to see your healthcare provider urgently or consider going to the emergency department. They will probably order blood tests and possibly repeat the ultrasound to monitor your condition closely. Please do not ignore these symptoms and seek help immediately.\n\n## Output (b):\n Can you describe the results of the test and how it relates to the pain and pain management? Also, I have been taking the medicine as directed, but I feel pain and pain are still prominent.

I believe I may be more vulnerable than the average person my age to get Coronavirus, due to my weakened immune system? Should I be self isolating? I am ok to do so\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIf you're living in an area affected by COVID-19, it's prudent to take extra precautions due to your health history and underlying autoimmune condition. This includes practicing good hygiene such as washing your hands regularly, avoiding large gatherings if possible, maintaining social distance from people who are sick, and wearing a mask when necessary. \n\nGiven your medical history, you potentially could be at a higher risk for severe illness if you do contract the virus, so self-isolating can be one measure to reduce exposure. However, not everyone needs to self-isolate unless recommended or required based on travel history, exposure to infected individuals, or showing symptoms of being sick. Please consult with your healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.\n\nIn addition to following general protective measures against the virus, remember to manage your Hashimoto\u2019s disease well, which typically includes taking your medication as prescribed, attending all necessary check-ups, eating healthily, and exercising regularly.\n\nThese recommendations are based on current public health guidelines and may change as more is learned about the virus.

My last ferritin level was 342, 20 days back. My ferritin level has been as high as 390. My TIBC, UIBC, iron, and iron saturation have always been within normal range. My glucose has always ranged from 100 to 104. I was tested for hemochromatosis and results are negative. My doctors keep telling me that we will just watch my ferritin level and I have bloodwork done every six months. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year. I am looking for some answers and some help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nFerritin is a protein that stores iron in your body, and the ferritin test measures the amount of ferritin in your blood. Normally, as you stated, high ferritin levels can indicate conditions where your body stores too much iron. Hemochromatosis is one such condition, but you mention being tested for this with negative results.\n\nElevated ferritin levels can also occur due to inflammation, liver disease, malignant diseases, or other chronic disorders. Since you are diagnosed with fibromyalgia - which is a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body - this could be contributing to your elevated ferritin levels. \n\nHowever, only your healthcare provider who understands your history and clinical profile will be able to piece together these puzzle pieces. Moreover, ferritin can increase depending upon lifestyle factors too like alcohol intake, diet, physical activity levels, etc.\n\nAlso, mildly elevated glucose levels might indicate impaired fasting glucose (pre-diabetes). Please try to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent type 2 diabetes: regular exercise, normal weight, balanced food choices are always recommended.\n\nPlease consult your doctor about any changes in your medical condition or new symptoms.\n\n## Output (b):\n Can you tell us a bit more about your medical history and what you are experiencing?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection caused by an imbalance in the normal bacteria found in your vagina. It's true that if left untreated, it can lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, it causing infertility directly is less common. That being said, it is still important to treat BV.\n\nIf standard treatments like Metronidazole or Clindamycin are not working for you, you should certainly revisit your doctor who may explore other treatment options. Refractory BV sometimes requires long-term or recurrent treatments. Don't hesitate to include natural alternatives under supervision, such as probiotics which have been shown to help reestablish healthy vaginal flora.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining excellent genital hygiene might be helpful \u2013 clean your external genital area gently with mild unscented soap, avoid douching, avoid irritants like bubble baths, sprays etc., and ensure underwear are always clean and dry.\n\nYou should also get regularly tested for STIs since having BV may increase your susceptibility to them. Lastly, implementing safe sex practices would be beneficial too, as new sexual partners can alter the bacterial balance in your vagina.\n\nRemember none of this constitutes direct medical advice. It\u2019s crucial you continue discussing your concerns and symptoms face-to-face with your treating physician as they'll provide guidance based on direct examination, tests, and broader medical history.\n\n## Output (b):\n We will need to schedule an appointment to discuss this further, but in the meantime, can you tell me more about your symptoms and we will see if there is anything we can do to address this issue.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Initially, it used to happen only in winter 4 to 5 years back and then gradually started in rainy days also. Now in summer also while sweating. It is so irritating like that I am going to be mad. I have stopped using soap and also took Clonafit 0.25 mg and Betonix- 10 prescribed by a dermatologist but there is no improvement. Please help me out of this.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like you might be experiencing a condition called aquagenic pruritus or cholinergic urticaria - both of these conditions can cause itching after exposure to water (like after showering) or when the body heats up (like during exercise, resulting in sweating). Aquagenic pruritus and cholinergic urticaria are conditions that often benefit from proper moisturization, anti-itch creams, oral antihistamines, or even prescription medication in more severe cases. \n\nHowever, bear in mind it is crucial to get a year-round, confirmed diagnosis first. I would recommend seeing a dermatologist for an examination if you have not had one recently so that they may confirm exactly what is going on. They may want to perform an allergy test and may also check your liver and kidney function with blood tests as diseases of these organs can sometimes manifest this way. It's important to explore other possibilities such as other types of dermatitis, scabies, thyroid issues, among others. If possible, take note of what seems to trigger the itching and how long it lasts which could provide clues about its source.\n\nRemember, only use medications based on doctor advice and apply a hypoallergenic moisturizer to your skin immediately after getting out of the bath while your skin is still damp. This helps lock in moisture and provides a protective barrier. Additionally, consider using a gentle soap-free cleanser, cool bathing water instead of hot, reduce the duration of your baths/showers, and\n\n## Output (b):\n I will take down your query and pass it on to the right specialist for a better diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I'd like to assure you that feeling worried and anxious about these symptoms is perfectly normal. According to your description, it seems you've been thoroughly examined by several doctors and specialists who have ruled out heart conditions and other obvious causes for your discomfort.\n\nThe symptoms you're describing - facial tightness, chest burning sensation, the fact they are relief temporarily by food, alcohol, lying down, or exercising - do not immediately point to one clear diagnosis. Anxiety can indeed create physical manifestations that are very real and sometimes medical tests cannot detect this because it's linked to our nervous system responding to stress.\n\nMusculoskeletal issues (such as tension in the muscles of the neck, shoulders, which then manifests itself on face) could also be plausible especially if you're under a lot of stress or have poor posture. Acid reflux or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) could explain both chest burning and potentially facial discomfort, given its chronic nature, but would usually accompany other gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nOne important thing is that you noticed a decrease in intensity over time, which might suggest improvement. My advice would be to follow up with your primary care physician, continue to monitor the symptoms and their triggers, consider psychological counseling to help manage any potential anxiety, and perhaps investigate more into gastroenterological or musculoskeletal possibilities. If symptoms persist or worsen, further diagnostic testing might be warranted. This is just an opinion based on your description, please consult with your healthcare provider for definitive diagnosis and\n\n## Output (b):\n Doctor, I have a question, question regarding the patient's condition. The patient has been experiencing some issues, including a feeling of tightness in the chest and the back, which has been going on for a few days. The patient has also been having some problems with their face, feeling tightness and discomfort. Additionally, the patient has been having some issues with their heart, as they have been feeling some pain and discomfort. The patient has been trying to find a way to relieve this pain and discomfort, but nothing seems to be working. They have been trying to see a neurologist to see if it is related to their nerves, as they are concerned about the possibility of neurological damage. However, they are also worried about the possibility of more serious conditions, like heart problems.

She had been treated for TB (tuberculosis) of the abdomen as her ultrasound of abdomen finding was thicken bowel loop. In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition. But, her neuro problem of numbness in her legs and loss of sensation in legs still continues. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear about the distressing medical situation with your mother. Your mother's clinical case seems quite complicated and must have been overseen by multiple specialized physicians. It sounds like she may have developed peripheral neuropathy as a complication of her TB treatment, which can be caused by certain anti-tuberculosis medications. Her back pain could be due to the compression injury in spine.\n\nAlso, the use of steroids might have led to a rise in blood sugar levels causing the distress regarding breathlessness and hospital admission; this is something often seen in patients on long term steroid therapy. \n\nWhile I'd heavily advise to continue consulting her team of doctors regarding the current status and necessary adjustment of her treatments, considering her complaints of persistent numbness and loss of sensation in legs, a neurological consultation is clearly recommended right away. This condition could be due to several reasons including nerve damage from her TB or its treatment, adverse effect of other medications, diabetes which may have further exacerbated due to steroid usage, or even nutritional deficiencies. A neurologist will do the detailed examination and also decide if any investigations like Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) are necessary.\n\nTake note that controlling her blood sugar levels frequently would be an important part of managing her symptoms as high sugar levels tend to make neuropathic symptoms worse. If arthritis diagnosed, physical therapy along with medication aid could improvise locomotion and relieve some discomfort. \n\nIn complex cases such as these, communication among all her treating physicians is key so the\n\n## Output (b):\n I'm her assistant and I'm also a student of medicine.

I am taking Afrin spray for an hour and one pill of Sudafed. I developed a similar condition of cold and sinus infection before six months. I had severe clogging of ears. I was given Amoxicillin for five days and Prednisone 5 mg. My ENT doctor examined my ears and told me that there was no issue with the eardrum. He diagnosed it as eustachian tube issue. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHello,\n\nGiven your current symptoms and past medical history, it sounds like you may be experiencing a similar episode of Eustachian tube dysfunction possibly related to a cold or sinus infection. \n\nEustachian tubes can get blocked due to inflammation from allergies, colds, sinus infections, etc., which might lead to feelings of pressure, fullness or clogging in the ear. Your current treatment with Afrin (a decongestant nasal spray) and Sudafed (an oral decongestant), is generally recommended for managing such conditions.\n\nHowever, if your symptoms persist or worsen, I suggest that you consult with your ENT doctor again. They might want to repeat the use of antibiotics like Amoxicillin if they suspect there is an active underlying infection, or even corticosteroids like Prednisone to alleviate inflammation. In some cases, other treatment modalities such as special exercises (Eustachian tube dilation exercises), or clinical procedures might also be required to open up these tubes.\n\nPlease remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with your healthcare provider for accurate information.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n I will be your assistant for today.

Our first kid is just 1 year old now and it was a Cesarean. We are not in a position to have a second child now. Her LMP was 22nd of last month. I read that Mifepristone can induce abortion. Is it a safe drug? Do we have to consult doctor for taking this drug? What are all the possible side effects? Is that drug 100 percent reliable? Is there any other options? Whether this drug is available without doctor\\s prescription? Thank you.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I cannot recommend inducing an abortion without your wife seeing a healthcare professional. \n\nMifepristone used in combination with misoprostol is commonly used for medical abortions but it should only be taken under the guidance and supervision of a qualified health care provider due to potential complications. The safety and efficacy of this medication largely depend on the gestational age, the dose, and how it's administrated.\n\nSide effects can include heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea among others. While complications are rare, they do exist and can be life-threatening including severe bleeding or infection. \n\nFurthermore, Mifepristone's effectiveness rate is not 100%. On its own, mifepristone is less effective; thus, it is usually given in combine with misoprostol. Together, they are about 95 - 98% effective when administered correctly up until the 10th week of pregnancy.\n\nMoreover, in many countries, Mifepristone and other drugs that induce abortion are typically regulated medicines, which means they must be prescribed by a licensed healthcare provider after determining that the use of these medications is safe and appropriate for the individual patient's situation.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that using this type of medication without consulting her doctor first can lead to significant health risks. Your best option is to consult with your family doctor or gynecologist who can guide you with safe methods taking into account your wife's general health and specific condition.\n\n\n\n## Output (b):\n I will take down the details and connect you to the right specialist.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My mother is 50 years old. She complains of episodic, sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon. This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother. She has a history of menorrhagia and cycles have become more irregular now. Then, diagnostic D and C was performed last year, which was normal. She will not smoke or drink. She sleeps 4 to 6 hours daily and snores at night.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your description, it seems like your mother is experiencing a multitude of symptoms. The sudden loss of weight bearing ability in the left Achilles tendon indicating some weakness or potential damage which can result from inadequate blood flow, nerve damage or inflammation from diseases such as arthritis and potentially an effects of age.\n\nThe knee and hip pain with swelling could be due to her osteoarthritis or possibly other form of arthritis. Difficulty in movement further indicates this condition causing joint stiffness and immobility.\n\nHer hypertension is reportedly controlled, but she should continue taking her prescribed medication (Bisoprolol and Amlodipine). The kidney stones may be a cause of her lumbar area pain; depending on the size and location of the stones, treatment options may vary.\n\nThe occasional constipation could be related to her diet or potentially certain medications.\n\nYour mother's gynecological history suggests hormonal fluctuations especially with irregular menstrual cycles. This requires close monitoring considering the family's history of uterine cancer.\n\nFor her sleep pattern, if there are signs of distress like difficulty breathing or momentary stops in breathing during snoring, they might suggest presence of conditions like sleep apnea, which would need evaluation.\n\nGiven this complex health scenario, I recommend having a detailed consultation with your mother's primary care provider who can guide you for specialist consultations if required. Please make sure she continues her current medications, maintains adequate hydration and follows a balanced diet. She should also get regular exercise as tolerated considering her joint issues.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n I will take down the details and prepare the questionnaire for the patient to answer.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}
