It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I will take down your request and pass it on to the right specialist. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n## Output (b):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you in person, as that would be unethical and irresponsible. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nBased on your description, it sounds like you may have developed epididymitis, which is inflammation of the epididymis (a coiled tube at the back of the testicle). This can sometimes occur after infections like mumps. The pain and swelling suggest ongoing inflammation. \n\nIt's possible the infection may still be present, especially if the symptoms have persisted or recurred after antibiotic treatment. I would recommend being evaluated by your doctor again. They can examine you, order tests if needed, and determine if further antibiotic treatment is warranted.\n\nWithout an exam, I cannot recommend specific antibiotics. Your doctor will be able to choose the most appropriate antibiotic based on the type of infection, your history, and local resistance patterns. Some common options for epididymitis include fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin or cephalosporins like ceftriaxone. But your doctor will make the best recommendation.\n\nIn the meantime, scrotal support, anti-inflammatories, and rest may help provide some symptom relief. But you should follow up with your doctor soon for a re-evaluation and to make sure any infection is properly treated. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

details to provide specific medical advice. However, cocaine use can negatively impact fertility and pregnancy. It is best to stop using cocaine and other drugs, eat a healthy diet, get regular exercise, avoid alcohol and tobacco, and see your doctor before trying to conceive. Sperm health can take around 3 months to improve after stopping cocaine.

I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Can you also provide some information about your overall health and any other medications you are taking, including the Yaz pill, to better understand your situation and provide the best answer to your question?\n\n## Output (b):\n Based on your description, it sounds like you may be experiencing some irregular bleeding after skipping your withdrawal bleeds for several months while on Yaz birth control pills. Here are a few points:\n\n- It's common to have breakthrough bleeding or spotting when you skip or delay withdrawal bleeds for an extended period of time on birth control pills. The brown discharge you're experiencing now is likely just residual bleeding clearing out.\n\n- As long as you are not having heavy bleeding that requires changing a pad frequently, or the bleeding is not accompanied by severe pain, fever, or other concerning symptoms, it is likely benign. \n\n- I would recommend continuing to take your active birth control pills as normal. The bleeding should stop within a few days. If it persists for more than 7-10 days or gets heavier, contact your doctor.\n\n- In the future, it's best not to skip more than 2-3 withdrawal bleeds in a row on birth control pills, as doing so can disrupt the stability of your uterine lining and lead to unpredictable bleeding. \n\n- Make sure to use a backup contraceptive method like condoms if you have breakthrough bleeding, as the pills may not be as effective at preventing pregnancy during this time.\n\nOverall, this sounds like typical breakthrough bleeding that should resolve soon. But let me know if you have any other concerns or the bleeding persists or worsens. In that case, making an appointment with your gynecologist to be evaluated may be a good idea.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Children's eyes can change rapidly during growth spurts.\n\n- Make sure he has properly fitted glasses with polycarbonate lenses to protect his eyes. Anti-reflective coating can also help reduce eye strain.\n\n- Encourage him to wear his glasses full time, especially for any near work like reading or using screens. This helps reduce eye strain.\n\n- Make sure he takes regular visual breaks when doing near work. The 20-20-20 rule is good - every 20 minutes, look up at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. \n\n- Ensure he has good lighting when reading or on screens. Position screens below eye level.\n\n- Limit screen time and encourage more outdoor/distance vision activities to give his eyes a rest.\n\n- Consider low vision aids if needed - things like large print books, magnifiers, and audio books.\n\n- Monitor for signs of eye strain like rubbing eyes, headaches, blurry vision.\n\n- Discuss possibility of specialty contacts or implantable lenses in the future to reduce myopia progression.\n\n- Maintain a healthy diet with leafy greens and omega-3s. Stay active and get enough sleep.\n\n- See an ophthalmologist for a full eye health evaluation to rule out any complications.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! Controlling myopia progression is important to preserve his vision long-term.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I'm the assistant, can you tell me more about the procedure and what the doctor discussed regarding the removal and recovery?\n\n## Output (b):\n I do not have medical training, so I cannot provide medical advice about your specific situation. However, I can offer some general information.\n\nIt's common to develop swelling and hardness in the area where a wisdom tooth was extracted, as the tissues heal and inflammation occurs. This is often worst about 3-5 days after the extraction and then gradually improves over the next week or two. The stitches themselves can also cause firmness. \n\nSince you just had the lower wisdom tooth extracted 6 days ago, it's likely the lump you are feeling is normal post-operative swelling and inflammation. Using ice packs on the outside of your cheek can help reduce this. Staying on the antibiotics and ibuprofen as prescribed is also important. \n\nHowever, any increasing swelling, pain, redness, or pus would warrant contacting the oral surgeon to be evaluated for a possible infection. Persistent numbness or tingling could also be a concern.\n\nI would recommend following up with the oral surgeon who performed the extraction for an exam, especially if the lump persists more than 2 weeks or you develop any worrisome symptoms. They can best evaluate the surgical site and determine if you are having expected post-op changes or if any complications are developing.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

It was my first intercourse with a sex worker and I am worrying about expose to HIV. I have started fearing from the minute where I had broken condom intercourse and she said to me that she does not have HIV and they never allow anyone to have sex without a condom because of fear of getting infected. So there is no need to worry but I cannot believe her and started studying about HIV and its symptoms and I have a feeling of infection because I got red dots in my finger pits and cold and throat infection.I want to know what are the red dots on my finger which I got? I got it tested many times in those three months and got a negative result. I am worrying abt six months test.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I will take down your question and answer it later.\n\n## Output (b):\n I understand your concerns, but try not to worry excessively. Here are a few points:\n\n- The risk of HIV transmission from a single episode of vaginal sex with a broken condom is low, estimated to be less than 1-2%. The risk is even lower if the sex worker did not have HIV.\n\n- Red dots on your fingers are unlikely to be related to HIV. HIV typically causes a rash in early infection that is diffuse, red, and maculopapular (flat with bumps). Localized red dots sound more like insect bites or another common skin condition.\n\n- Cold, sore throat, and other flu-like symptoms are also not specific signs of HIV. Many illnesses can cause these symptoms.\n\n- You have tested negative multiple times in the 3 months since the exposure. The tests are very accurate by 6 weeks, so this is reassuring.\n\n- I understand waiting for the 6 month test causes anxiety, but try to be patient. Repeated testing in the absence of symptoms is not recommended. \n\n- Focus on your health, get good sleep, eat well, exercise, and find healthy ways to cope with your anxiety until the 6 month test. The odds are very much in your favor that you did not contract HIV from this encounter. But if for any reason the test is positive, HIV is very treatable today.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! Try not to obsess over this, as the likelihood of infection seems very low based on your report.

Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I will answer the question, but I need to consult with the doctor about the medical advice.\n\n## Output (b):\n Based on the information provided, here are a few thoughts:\n\n- The finding of small lung nodules on CT scan can be common, especially as we get older. The vast majority of small nodules like yours turn out to be benign. \n\n- The recommendation to repeat a CT scan in 6-12 months is a reasonable approach to monitor stability. The fact your nodules have not grown over 6 months is reassuring that they are likely benign.\n\n- Additional testing like a PET scan could be considered for further evaluation, but is usually not recommended for nodules <8mm given the low likelihood of cancer.\n\n- Biopsy of small nodules is invasive and usually not recommended given the risks versus low probability of cancer.\n\n- Since your nodules are small and stable over 6 months, it would be reasonable to continue monitoring with repeat CT scans at intervals (e.g. yearly for 1-2 years). If they remain stable, ongoing monitoring may not be needed.\n\n- Medications or other therapies are not indicated for benign nodules like yours that are just being monitored.\n\n- If the nodules grow significantly on future scans, then further evaluation and biopsy may be recommended. But stability is reassuring.\n\nIn summary, your nodules appear to be benign based on their small size and stability. Continued monitoring with repeat CT scans is a reasonable approach.

After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Can you also provide some assistance with the patient records, and perhaps we can review them to better understand the patient's condition.\n\n## Output (b):\n I do not have enough medical information to make a diagnosis or determine the cause of your delayed menstruation. Some potential reasons could be:\n\n- Pregnancy is still possible even with a negative blood test if it was taken too early. Retest in 1-2 weeks if still no period.\n\n- Stress or anxiety from having sex for the first time can disrupt menstrual cycles. \n\n- Starting new medications like birth control pills can cause irregular bleeding initially.\n\n- Conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome or thyroid disorders may cause missed/irregular periods.\n\nI would recommend being patient for now, but follow up with your gynecologist again if your period does not start within the next couple of weeks.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I'll take care of the questions, but you should consult a specialist.\n\n## Output (b):\n I do not have medical training, so I cannot provide medical advice. However, ingesting phenol can be dangerous and medical attention should be sought immediately if this occurs. Some general information:\n\n- Phenol is a toxic chemical that can cause burns to the mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach if ingested. Even small amounts can be harmful. \n\n- Effects may include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, muscle spasms, irregular heartbeats, seizures, loss of consciousness and collapse.\n\n- Treatment involves immediately diluting the phenol by drinking milk or water. Inducing vomiting may help eliminate unabsorbed phenol. \n\n- Seeking emergency medical care is crucial for monitoring and treating complications like respiratory failure, kidney damage, arrhythmias, seizures and shock. Treatment may involve pumping the stomach, administering activated charcoal, intravenous fluids, anti-seizure medication, etc.\n\n- Long term, ingesting phenol can result in strictures or scarring of the esophagus. Follow up with a doctor is recommended after initial emergency treatment.\n\nWhile I cannot provide specific medical advice, I strongly suggest your friend seeks immediate emergency care to be evaluated and treated for potential phenol poisoning and complications. I hope he gets the appropriate medical care he needs.

It is never at night or during the day. It can happen more than once sometimes. If I move, roll over, or get up, I can make it stop. It does not hurt and is very fast. What does this sound like?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I think we should take a closer look. Can you describe the symptoms and how they affect your day?\n\n## Output (b):\n Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. However, some possibilities for brief, localized numbness like you describe include:\n\n- Migraine aura - Migraines can cause temporary numbness or tingling on one side of the head. The aura phase happens before the actual headache pain starts.\n\n- Transient ischemic attack (TIA) - Also called a mini-stroke, a TIA causes temporary neurologic symptoms like numbness due to a brief disruption in blood flow to the brain. TIAs usually last less than 5 minutes.\n\n- Hemiplegic migraine - This rare type of migraine can cause temporary weakness or numbness on one side of the body, similar to a stroke. The numbness may precede the headache.\n\n- Seizure - Some focal seizures can cause numbness or odd sensations in parts of the body. Seizures upon waking are not uncommon.\n\n- Nerve compression - Pressure on a nerve in the head/neck from sleeping position could potentially cause temporary numbness. Changing position relieves it.\n\nWithout examining you or knowing your medical history, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. I would recommend following up with your primary care doctor for an evaluation, especially if the numbness episodes become more frequent or severe. Diagnostic tests like an MRI of the brain may be needed to identify the cause.

Last week I had brown discharge with mild lower abdominal pain and was prescribed Susten 200 mg (oral). Now, I am feeling the pain frequently in the right lower abdomen with mild bleeding and pain. It is less when I lie on bed. What to do?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Can you describe the results of the test and how it relates to the pain and pain management? Also, I have been taking the medicine as directed, but I feel pain and pain are still prominent. What should I do?\n\n## Output (b):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you may be experiencing complications related to an early pregnancy. Since you are having abdominal pain and bleeding, it is important that you follow up promptly with your doctor. Here are some suggestions on next steps:\n\n- Contact your doctor's office right away and inform them about the worsening pain, bleeding, and other symptoms you are experiencing. Early pregnancy complications like ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage can sometimes cause pain/bleeding and need medical evaluation.\n\n- Your doctor may want you to come in for an exam, ultrasound, or other testing to determine the cause of your symptoms. Follow their recommendations closely. \n\n- Take it easy and rest - lying down, avoiding strenuous activity, and pelvic rest may help reduce discomfort. \n\n- Monitor bleeding closely - track the amount, color, etc and report any significant changes to your doctor. Heavy bleeding or passing clots may indicate a problem.\n\n- Take any prescribed medications properly. Susten is commonly used to help support early pregnancy. \n\n- Watch for signs of infection - fevers, chills, foul-smelling discharge. Report these urgently if they occur.\n\n- Stay well-hydrated and eat a balanced diet. Proper nutrition is important in pregnancy.\n\n- Avoid putting anything in the vagina - no tampons, intercourse, douches etc until evaluated.\n\nLet your doctor guide next steps. Prompt care is important for your health and the outcome of the pregnancy. Please keep me updated, and don't hesitate to ask any other questions!

I believe I may be more vulnerable than the average person my age to get Coronavirus, due to my weakened immune system? Should I be self isolating? I am ok to do so\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I'm Assistant to Dr. Wright, and I'll be helping with this consultation. Can you tell me more about your symptoms and how you're feeling today?\n\n## Output (b):\n Here are a few thoughts on your situation:\n\n- Having conditions like glandular fever, shingles, and influenza in your medical history does not necessarily mean you are immunocompromised. However, Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune condition, can weaken the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections.\n\n- People with weakened immune systems are considered higher risk for developing more severe illness from COVID-19. Those over 60 or with underlying medical conditions are advised to take extra precautions.\n\n- At 40 years old, you are not yet in the highest risk age group. However, having an autoimmune disorder does potentially put you at increased risk compared to a healthy 40-year-old.\n\n- Self-isolation is a good precaution if you are able to work/study from home and have others who can help with errands. This minimizes potential exposure to the virus. Even if you do not have symptoms, avoiding public places can help protect you.\n\n- Be vigilant about hand washing, avoiding those who are sick, and disinfecting high-touch surfaces. Follow public health recommendations in your area regarding social distancing.\n\n- Connect with your doctor to discuss your medical history and specific risk factors. They can best assess your situation and make recommendations about additional precautions you should take. Monitoring your health closely and seeking prompt medical care if you become ill is also important.\n\nIn summary, your autoimmune condition likely does warrant taking extra precautions, including self-isolation if feasible, to minimize COVID-19 exposure and complications. Connecting with your doctor is advisable to review your medical history and risk factors.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

My last ferritin level was 342, 20 days back. My ferritin level has been as high as 390. My TIBC, UIBC, iron, and iron saturation have always been within normal range. My glucose has always ranged from 100 to 104. I was tested for hemochromatosis and results are negative. My doctors keep telling me that we will just watch my ferritin level and I have bloodwork done every six months. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year. I am looking for some answers and some help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Can you tell us a bit more about your medical history and what you are experiencing?\n\n## Output (b):\n Here are a few thoughts on your situation:\n\n- An elevated ferritin level over 300 ng/mL in women is concerning for possible iron overload or inflammation. Your doctors are right to monitor this every 6 months. \n\n- It's good that your transferrin saturation is normal, as this makes hemochromatosis less likely. The negative genetic test also makes hemochromatosis unlikely.\n\n- Fibromyalgia can sometimes cause inflammation that leads to elevated ferritin. The fibromyalgia could be contributing to your high ferritin.\n\n- Other potential causes could be fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, or chronic inflammation. It would be reasonable to check a ALT, AST, and HbA1c to screen for these. An ultrasound of your liver may also be helpful.\n\n- Treatment wise, managing the fibromyalgia and reducing any inflammation is key. A low-iron diet may help reduce iron absorption. Occasional phlebotomy is sometimes done for very elevated ferritin, but risks depleting iron stores.\n\n- I would recommend following up with your doctor, sharing your concerns, and asking about further evaluation to determine the cause. Additional testing and potential treatment options can be discussed. The goal is to find the underlying reason for the elevated ferritin.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to provide more guidance on next steps in evaluating an elevated ferritin.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n We will need to schedule an appointment to discuss this further, but in the meantime, can you tell me more about your symptoms and we will see if there is anything we can do to address this issue.\n\n## Output (b):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you, but I can share some general information.\n\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection caused by an overgrowth of certain bacteria. It often causes a fishy odor, discharge, and irritation. While BV itself does not directly cause infertility, having BV can increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease if left untreated. Pelvic inflammatory disease is a serious infection of the reproductive organs that can lead to scarring and impaired fertility. \n\nThe good news is that BV is treatable. Metronidazole is a common antibiotic used to treat it, but it doesn't work for everyone. Other treatment options include clindamycin or boric acid suppositories. I'd recommend seeing your doctor again to explore other treatment options. They can also test to see if you still have BV and make sure other infections are ruled out.\n\nSome tips to help manage BV:\n\n- Take probiotics to help restore the natural vaginal bacteria balance.\n- Avoid douching, which can disrupt the vaginal pH. \n- Use mild, unscented soaps and wear cotton underwear.\n- Don't have sex until treatment is complete and symptoms resolve.\n- Get re-tested after treatment to confirm the BV is gone.\n\nCatching and properly treating BV is important for your reproductive health. Seeking care from your doctor is the best way to get the right diagnosis and treatment. I hope this helps provide some reassurance and guidance until you can be evaluated in person.

Initially, it used to happen only in winter 4 to 5 years back and then gradually started in rainy days also. Now in summer also while sweating. It is so irritating like that I am going to be mad. I have stopped using soap and also took Clonafit 0.25 mg and Betonix- 10 prescribed by a dermatologist but there is no improvement.

Antihistamines like cetirizine or loratadine can help block the histamine response that causes itching. Take them daily as prescribed.\n\n- Avoid hot showers/baths. Lukewarm water instead. Pat dry gently after bathing, don't rub. Apply a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer while skin is still damp. \n\n- Wear loose, breathable fabrics like cotton to allow sweat to evaporate and skin to breathe. Avoid wool and polyester that can trap sweat.\n\n- Cool showers, cold compresses, or chilling the itchy area can provide relief. \n\n- Keep fingernails trimmed to avoid scratching and damaging skin. Apply cold packs or topical numbing creams if needed to resist urge to scratch.\n\n- If itching is severe, your doctor may prescribe stronger antihistamines or other medications like leukotriene inhibitors.\n\n- Try to identify and avoid triggers like heat, humidity, sweat, stress, spicy foods, alcohol, etc that make symptoms worse. \n\n- See an allergist for allergy testing if environmental allergies are suspected. Desensitization may help.\n\nLet me know if the itching does not improve in 2-3 weeks on the current treatment. We may need to re-evaluate your skin condition or adjust medications.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Doctor, I have a question, question regarding the patient's condition. The patient has been experiencing some issues, including a feeling of tightness in the chest and the back, which has been going on for a few days. The patient has also been having some problems with their face, feeling tightness and discomfort. Additionally, the patient has been having some issues with their heart, as they have been feeling some pain and discomfort. The patient has been trying to find a way to relieve this pain and discomfort, but nothing seems to be working. They have been trying to see a neurologist to see if it is related to their nerves, as they are concerned about the possibility of neurological damage. However, they are also worried about the possibility of more serious conditions, like heart problems. Can you please take a look at their medical records and tell us what you think might be going on?\n\n## Output (b):\n Based on your description, it sounds like you have been experiencing some persistent facial tightness and tension, as well as chest burning, over the past few months. While anxiety is certainly a possibility, given the normal test results so far, I would recommend getting evaluated by your primary care doctor for other potential causes.\n\nSome things that could be considered:\n\n- Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction - This can cause tightness and pain in the jaw, face, and neck. Your doctor can examine your jaw joint and muscles. Treatment may include splint therapy, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, etc.\n\n- Cervicogenic headache - This is a headache caused by neck issues, like muscle tightness or joint problems. It can cause face and head pain. Your doctor may recommend imaging of the neck, physical therapy, medications, etc.\n\n- Nerve entrapment - Issues like trigeminal neuralgia or occipital neuralgia can cause facial pain and tightness. Evaluation by a neurologist may be needed. \n\n- Bruxism - Clenching or grinding of the teeth, often at night. This can lead to facial tightness and pain. A dentist can fit you for a night guard.\n\n- Stress/anxiety - While it may not be the sole cause, stress and anxiety can certainly exacerbate symptoms like muscle tension. Relaxation techniques, counseling, etc. may help.\n\nI would recommend following up with your primary care physician for a more thorough evaluation. Diagnostic tests like an MRI or CT scan may be considered to look for potential neurological causes. Trying treatments like physical therapy, massage, and anti-inflammatories may also be reasonable. But getting an accurate diagnosis is important, so persistent symptoms should be evaluated further.

She had been treated for TB (tuberculosis) of the abdomen as her ultrasound of abdomen finding was thicken bowel loop. In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition. But, her neuro problem of numbness in her legs and loss of sensation in legs still continues. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I'm her assistant and I'm also a student of medicine.

tuberculosis, peripheral neuropathy, spinal compression fracture, and possible arthritis. She has been on several medications which seem to provide limited benefit and some may have caused side effects like high blood sugar.\n\n- The numbness and loss of sensation in her legs could be due to the peripheral neuropathy, which may have been caused by the TB treatment. However, spinal compression can also cause similar symptoms. \n\n- Arthritis is a possibility given her age, but should be confirmed with imaging and lab tests. The steroids she was given can help with arthritis pain but have significant side effects especially at high doses for prolonged periods.\n\n- At this stage, I would recommend:\n\n1) Review of all her records by a senior physician who can look at the case holistically.\n\n2) Stop any unnecessary medications to avoid side effects and interactions.\n\n3) Confirm the arthritis diagnosis with imaging and labs. If confirmed, use lower doses of steroids (like prednisolone <10 mg/day) and/or other arthritis drugs under guidance.\n\n4) Evaluate if spine surgery is needed for the compression fracture. Physiotherapy can also help.\n\n5) For neuropathy, medications like pregabalin or duloxetine may provide some relief. Vitamin B12 is also important.\n\n6) Optimize management of other conditions like diabetes. \n\n7) Most importantly, focus on her quality of life, nutrition, preventing falls and pressure sores. Palliative care input can help provide a holistic approach.\n\nI hope this helps provide some guidance on how to approach this complex situation. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions. Wishing your mother an improvement in her condition.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I am taking Afrin spray for an hour and one pill of Sudafed. I developed a similar condition of cold and sinus infection before six months. I had severe clogging of ears. I was given Amoxicillin for five days and Prednisone 5 mg. My ENT doctor examined my ears and told me that there was no issue with the eardrum. He diagnosed it as eustachian tube issue. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I will be your assistant for today. I will take down the patient's history and conduct the physical examination.\n\n## Output (b):\n Here are a few suggestions based on the information provided:\n\n- Afrin nasal spray should only be used for 3-5 days maximum to avoid rebound congestion. Since this is a recurring issue, you may want to try using saline nasal spray and nasal irrigation instead for congestion relief.\n\n- Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) can help relieve sinus congestion and pressure. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids when taking decongestants.\n\n- Since you have a history of sinus infections, it would be reasonable to contact your doctor about getting another short course of antibiotics like amoxicillin. A 5-7 day course may help clear up the infection. \n\n- The prednisone you were given before helps reduce sinus inflammation. You could ask your doctor if a brief course would be appropriate again.\n\n- Applying warm compresses over the affected sinuses may also help provide relief. \n\n- Stay hydrated, rest, and consider using a humidifier. Saline nasal sprays can also help keep the nasal passages moisturized.\n\n- If symptoms persist or worsen, follow up with your ENT doctor to rule out any other underlying issues with your sinuses or eustachian tubes. You may need imaging or evaluation of your ears/sinuses.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! Hope this helps provide some guidance on managing your current symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Our first kid is just 1 year old now and it was a Cesarean. We are not in a position to have a second child now. Her LMP was 22nd of last month. I read that Mifepristone can induce abortion. Is it a safe drug? Do we have to consult doctor for taking this drug? What are all the possible side effects? Is that drug 100 percent reliable? Is there any other options? Whether this drug is available without doctor\\s prescription? Thank you.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I will take down the details and connect you to the right specialist.\n\n## Output (b):\n I cannot recommend or provide advice about using medication to induce abortion without medical supervision. If you have concerns about an unplanned pregnancy, I would advise speaking to a licensed healthcare provider about all options in a confidential and nonjudgmental setting. There are risks involved with taking any medication without medical guidance. It's important to discuss your situation openly with a doctor you trust to determine the safest course of action for your wife's health.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

My mother is 50 years old. She complains of episodic, sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon. This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother. She has a history of menorrhagia and cycles have become more irregular now. Then, diagnostic D and C was performed last year, which was normal. She will not smoke or drink. She sleeps 4 to 6 hours daily and snores at night.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I will take down the details and prepare the questionnaire for the patient to answer.\n\n## Output (b):\n Based on the description provided, here are my thoughts as a doctor:\n\n- The episodic loss of weight bearing ability and falls due to left Achilles tendon issues could indicate tendinitis or a partial tear. I would recommend an ultrasound or MRI to further evaluate. Rest, ice, compression and elevation when symptomatic along with physical therapy exercises may help. \n\n- The knee and hip pain are likely related to osteoarthritis. Weight loss, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and possibly joint injections can help manage the symptoms. X-rays may be needed to assess the extent of arthritis.\n\n- The shoulder stiffness and discomfort with overhead motions could be indicative of rotator cuff tendinitis or impingement. Physical therapy to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles and improve range of motion would be my first recommendation. Anti-inflammatory medication may also provide some relief. \n\n- The kidney stones and lumbar pain are likely related. Staying hydrated is important to prevent recurrent stones. Pain medication can help manage episodic pain flares.\n\n- For constipation, increasing fiber intake, staying hydrated, and over-the-counter laxatives can help. Ruling out any underlying gastrointestinal issues would be recommended.\n\n- Her history of hypertension, irregular menses, and family history of uterine cancer warrant continued close monitoring and age-appropriate cancer screening. Lifestyle modifications for high blood pressure management are encouraged.\n\n- Addressing sleep apnea concerns with a sleep study would be warranted given the snoring and limited sleep duration.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}
