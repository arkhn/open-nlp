It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you in person, as that would be unethical and irresponsible. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nBased on your description, it sounds like you may have developed epididymitis, which is inflammation of the epididymis (a coiled tube at the back of the testicle). This can sometimes occur after infections like mumps. The pain and swelling suggest ongoing inflammation. \n\nIt's possible the infection may still be present, especially if the symptoms have persisted or recurred after antibiotic treatment. I would recommend being evaluated by your doctor again. They can examine you, order tests if needed, and determine if further antibiotic treatment is warranted.\n\nWithout an exam, I cannot recommend specific antibiotics. Your doctor will be able to choose the most appropriate antibiotic based on the type of infection, your history, and local resistance patterns. Some common options for epididymitis include fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin or cephalosporins like ceftriaxone. But your doctor will make the best recommendation.\n\nIn the meantime, scrotal support, anti-inflammatories, and rest may help provide some symptom relief. But you should follow up with your doctor soon for a re-evaluation and to make sure any infection is properly treated.

I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on your description, it sounds like you may be experiencing some irregular bleeding after skipping your withdrawal bleeds for several months while on Yaz birth control pills. Here are a few points:\n\n- It's common to have breakthrough bleeding or spotting when you skip or delay withdrawal bleeds for an extended period of time on birth control pills. The brown discharge you're experiencing now is likely just residual bleeding clearing out.\n\n- As long as you are not having heavy bleeding that requires changing a pad frequently, or the bleeding is not accompanied by severe pain, fever, or other concerning symptoms, it is likely benign. \n\n- I would recommend continuing to take your active birth control pills as normal. The bleeding should stop within a few days. If it persists for more than 7-10 days or gets heavier, contact your doctor.\n\n- In the future, it's best not to skip more than 2-3 withdrawal bleeds in a row on birth control pills, as doing so can disrupt the stability of your uterine lining and lead to unpredictable bleeding. \n\n- Make sure to use a backup contraceptive method like condoms if you have breakthrough bleeding, as the pills may not be as effective at preventing pregnancy during this time.\n\nOverall, this sounds like typical breakthrough bleeding that should resolve soon. But let me know if you have any other concerns or the bleeding persists or worsens. In that case, making an appointment with your gynecologist to be evaluated may be a good idea.\n\n## Output (b):\n Has there been any changes to the patient's condition?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Can you suggest me what should I do?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions for caring for a child with high myopia (nearsightedness) in both eyes:\n\n- Get him a comprehensive eye exam every year to monitor for any changes in his prescription. Children's eyes can change rapidly during growth spurts.\n\n- Make sure he has properly fitted glasses with polycarbonate lenses to protect his eyes. Anti-reflective coating can also help reduce eye strain.\n\n- Encourage him to wear his glasses full time, especially for any near work like reading or using screens. This helps reduce eye strain.\n\n- Make sure he takes regular visual breaks when doing near work. The 20-20-20 rule is good - every 20 minutes, look up at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. \n\n- Ensure he has good lighting when reading or on screens. Position screens below eye level.\n\n- Limit screen time and encourage more outdoor/distance vision activities to give his eyes a rest.\n\n- Consider low vision aids if needed - things like large print books, magnifiers, and audio books.\n\n- Monitor for signs of eye strain like rubbing eyes, headaches, blurry vision.\n\n- Discuss possibility of specialty contacts or implantable lenses in the future to reduce myopia progression.\n\n- Maintain a healthy diet with leafy greens and omega-3s. Stay active and get enough sleep.\n\n- See an ophthalmologist for a full eye health evaluation to rule out any complications.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have medical training, so I cannot provide medical advice about your specific situation. However, I can offer some general information.\n\nIt's common to develop swelling and hardness in the area where a wisdom tooth was extracted, as the tissues heal and inflammation occurs. This is often worst about 3-5 days after the extraction and then gradually improves over the next week or two. The stitches themselves can also cause firmness. \n\nSince you just had the lower wisdom tooth extracted 6 days ago, it's likely the lump you are feeling is normal post-operative swelling and inflammation. Using ice packs on the outside of your cheek can help reduce this. Staying on the antibiotics and ibuprofen as prescribed is also important. \n\nHowever, any increasing swelling, pain, redness, or pus would warrant contacting the oral surgeon to be evaluated for a possible infection. Persistent numbness or tingling could also be a concern.\n\nI would recommend following up with the oral surgeon who performed the extraction for an exam, especially if the lump persists more than 2 weeks or you develop any worrisome symptoms. They can best evaluate the surgical site and determine if you are having expected post-op changes or if any complications are developing.\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your information.

It was my first intercourse with a sex worker and I am worrying about expose to HIV. I have started fearing from the minute where I had broken condom intercourse and she said to me that she does not have HIV and they never allow anyone to have sex without a condom because of fear of getting infected. So there is no need to worry but I cannot believe her and started studying about HIV and its symptoms and I have a feeling of infection because I got red dots in my finger pits and cold and throat infection.I want to know what are the red dots on my finger which I got? I got it tested many times in those three months and got a negative result. I am worrying abt six months test.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I understand your concerns, but try not to worry excessively. Here are a few points:\n\n- The risk of HIV transmission from a single episode of vaginal sex with a broken condom is low, estimated to be less than 1-2%. The risk is even lower if the sex worker did not have HIV.\n\n- Red dots on your fingers are unlikely to be related to HIV. HIV typically causes a rash in early infection that is diffuse, red, and maculopapular (flat with bumps). Localized red dots sound more like insect bites or another common skin condition.\n\n- Cold, sore throat, and other flu-like symptoms are also not specific signs of HIV. Many illnesses can cause these symptoms.\n\n- You have tested negative multiple times in the 3 months since the exposure. The tests are very accurate by 6 weeks, so this is reassuring.\n\n- I understand waiting for the 6 month test causes anxiety, but try to be patient. Repeated testing in the absence of symptoms is not recommended. \n\n- Focus on your health, get good sleep, eat well, exercise, and find healthy ways to cope with your anxiety until the 6 month test. The odds are very much in your favor that you did not contract HIV from this encounter. But if for any reason the test is positive, HIV is very treatable today.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! Try not to obsess over this, as the likelihood of infection seems very low based on your report.

Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, here are a few thoughts:\n\n- The finding of small lung nodules on CT scan can be common, especially as we get older. The vast majority of small nodules like yours turn out to be benign. \n\n- The recommendation to repeat a CT scan in 6-12 months is a reasonable approach to monitor stability. The fact your nodules have not grown over 6 months is reassuring that they are likely benign.\n\n- Additional testing like a PET scan could be considered for further evaluation, but is usually not recommended for nodules <8mm given the low likelihood of cancer.\n\n- Biopsy of small nodules is invasive and usually not recommended given the risks versus low probability of cancer.\n\n- Since your nodules are small and stable over 6 months, it would be reasonable to continue monitoring with repeat CT scans at intervals (e.g. yearly for 1-2 years). If they remain stable, ongoing monitoring may not be needed.\n\n- Medications or other therapies are not indicated for benign nodules like yours that are just being monitored.\n\n- If the nodules grow significantly on future scans, then further evaluation and biopsy may be recommended. But stability is reassuring.\n\nIn summary, your nodules appear to be benign based on their small size and stability. Continued monitoring with repeat CT scans is a reasonable approach.

After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical information to make a diagnosis or determine the cause of your delayed menstruation. Some potential reasons could be:\n\n- Pregnancy is still possible even with a negative blood test if it was taken too early. Retest in 1-2 weeks if still no period.\n\n- Stress or anxiety from having sex for the first time can disrupt menstrual cycles. \n\n- Starting new medications like birth control pills can cause irregular bleeding initially.\n\n- Conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome or thyroid disorders may cause missed/irregular periods.\n\nI would recommend being patient for now, but follow up with your gynecologist again if your period does not start within the next couple of weeks.

However, ingesting phenol can be dangerous and medical attention should be sought immediately if this occurs. Some general information:\n\n- Phenol is a toxic chemical that can cause burns to the mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach if ingested. Even small amounts can be harmful. \n\n- Effects may include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, muscle spasms, irregular heartbeats, seizures, loss of consciousness and collapse.\n\n- Treatment involves immediately diluting the phenol by drinking milk or water. Inducing vomiting may help eliminate unabsorbed phenol. \n\n- Seeking emergency medical care is crucial for monitoring and treating complications like respiratory failure, kidney damage, arrhythmias, seizures and shock. Treatment may involve pumping the stomach, administering activated charcoal, intravenous fluids, anti-seizure medication, etc.\n\n- Long term, ingesting phenol can result in strictures or scarring of the esophagus. Follow up with a doctor is recommended after initial emergency treatment.\n\nWhile I cannot provide specific medical advice, I strongly suggest your friend seeks immediate emergency care to be evaluated and treated for potential phenol poisoning and complications. I hope he gets the appropriate medical care he needs.

It is never at night or during the day. It can happen more than once sometimes. If I move, roll over, or get up, I can make it stop. It does not hurt and is very fast. What does this sound like?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. However, some possibilities for brief, localized numbness like you describe include:\n\n- Migraine aura - Migraines can cause temporary numbness or tingling on one side of the head. The aura phase happens before the actual headache pain starts.\n\n- Transient ischemic attack (TIA) - Also called a mini-stroke, a TIA causes temporary neurologic symptoms like numbness due to a brief disruption in blood flow to the brain. TIAs usually last less than 5 minutes.\n\n- Hemiplegic migraine - This rare type of migraine can cause temporary weakness or numbness on one side of the body, similar to a stroke. The numbness may precede the headache.\n\n- Seizure - Some focal seizures can cause numbness or odd sensations in parts of the body. Seizures upon waking are not uncommon.\n\n- Nerve compression - Pressure on a nerve in the head/neck from sleeping position could potentially cause temporary numbness. Changing position relieves it.\n\nWithout examining you or knowing your medical history, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. I would recommend following up with your primary care doctor for an evaluation, especially if the numbness episodes become more frequent or severe. Diagnostic tests like an MRI of the brain may be needed to identify the cause.

Last week I had brown discharge with mild lower abdominal pain and was prescribed Susten 200 mg (oral). Now, I am feeling the pain frequently in the right lower abdomen with mild bleeding and pain. It is less when I lie on bed. What to do?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you may be experiencing complications related to an early pregnancy. Since you are having abdominal pain and bleeding, it is important that you follow up promptly with your doctor. Here are some suggestions on next steps:\n\n- Contact your doctor's office right away and inform them about the worsening pain, bleeding, and other symptoms you are experiencing. Early pregnancy complications like ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage can sometimes cause pain/bleeding and need medical evaluation.\n\n- Your doctor may want you to come in for an exam, ultrasound, or other testing to determine the cause of your symptoms. Follow their recommendations closely. \n\n- Take it easy and rest - lying down, avoiding strenuous activity, and pelvic rest may help reduce discomfort. \n\n- Monitor bleeding closely - track the amount, color, etc and report any significant changes to your doctor. Heavy bleeding or passing clots may indicate a problem.\n\n- Take any prescribed medications properly. Susten is commonly used to help support early pregnancy. \n\n- Watch for signs of infection - fevers, chills, foul-smelling discharge. Report these urgently if they occur.\n\n- Stay well-hydrated and eat a balanced diet. Proper nutrition is important in pregnancy.\n\n- Avoid putting anything in the vagina - no tampons, intercourse, douches etc until evaluated.\n\nLet your doctor guide next steps. Prompt care is important for your health and the outcome of the pregnancy. Please keep me updated, and don't hesitate to ask any other questions! Wishing you the very best.\n\n## Output (b):\n What medications are you currently taking?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I believe I may be more vulnerable than the average person my age to get Coronavirus, due to my weakened immune system? Should I be self isolating? I am ok to do so\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your situation:\n\n- Having conditions like glandular fever, shingles, and influenza in your medical history does not necessarily mean you are immunocompromised. However, Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune condition, can weaken the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections.\n\n- People with weakened immune systems are considered higher risk for developing more severe illness from COVID-19. Those over 60 or with underlying medical conditions are advised to take extra precautions.\n\n- At 40 years old, you are not yet in the highest risk age group. However, having an autoimmune disorder does potentially put you at increased risk compared to a healthy 40-year-old.\n\n- Self-isolation is a good precaution if you are able to work/study from home and have others who can help with errands. This minimizes potential exposure to the virus. Even if you do not have symptoms, avoiding public places can help protect you.\n\n- Be vigilant about hand washing, avoiding those who are sick, and disinfecting high-touch surfaces. Follow public health recommendations in your area regarding social distancing.\n\n- Connect with your doctor to discuss your medical history and specific risk factors. They can best assess your situation and make recommendations about additional precautions you should take. Monitoring your health closely and seeking prompt medical care if you become ill is also important.\n\nIn summary, your autoimmune condition likely does warrant taking extra precautions, including self-isolation if feasible, to minimize COVID-19 exposure and complications. Connecting with your doctor is advisable to review your medical history and risk factors.\n\n## Output (b):\n What is your main symptom?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My last ferritin level was 342, 20 days back. My ferritin level has been as high as 390. My TIBC, UIBC, iron, and iron saturation have always been within normal range. My glucose has always ranged from 100 to 104. I was tested for hemochromatosis and results are negative. My doctors keep telling me that we will just watch my ferritin level and I have bloodwork done every six months. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year. I am looking for some answers and some help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your situation:\n\n- An elevated ferritin level over 300 ng/mL in women is concerning for possible iron overload or inflammation. Your doctors are right to monitor this every 6 months. \n\n- It's good that your transferrin saturation is normal, as this makes hemochromatosis less likely. The negative genetic test also makes hemochromatosis unlikely.\n\n- Fibromyalgia can sometimes cause inflammation that leads to elevated ferritin. The fibromyalgia could be contributing to your high ferritin.\n\n- Other potential causes could be fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, or chronic inflammation. It would be reasonable to check a ALT, AST, and HbA1c to screen for these. An ultrasound of your liver may also be helpful.\n\n- Treatment wise, managing the fibromyalgia and reducing any inflammation is key. A low-iron diet may help reduce iron absorption. Occasional phlebotomy is sometimes done for very elevated ferritin, but risks depleting iron stores.\n\n- I would recommend following up with your doctor, sharing your concerns, and asking about further evaluation to determine the cause. Additional testing and potential treatment options can be discussed. The goal is to find the underlying reason for the elevated ferritin.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to provide more guidance on next steps in evaluating an elevated ferritin.\n\n## Output (b):\n What about your family?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you, but I can share some general information.\n\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection caused by an overgrowth of certain bacteria. It often causes a fishy odor, discharge, and irritation. While BV itself does not directly cause infertility, having BV can increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease if left untreated. Pelvic inflammatory disease is a serious infection of the reproductive organs that can lead to scarring and impaired fertility. \n\nThe good news is that BV is treatable. Metronidazole is a common antibiotic used to treat it, but it doesn't work for everyone. Other treatment options include clindamycin or boric acid suppositories. I'd recommend seeing your doctor again to explore other treatment options. They can also test to see if you still have BV and make sure other infections are ruled out.\n\nSome tips to help manage BV:\n\n- Take probiotics to help restore the natural vaginal bacteria balance.\n- Avoid douching, which can disrupt the vaginal pH. \n- Use mild, unscented soaps and wear cotton underwear.\n- Don't have sex until treatment is complete and symptoms resolve.\n- Get re-tested after treatment to confirm the BV is gone.\n\nCatching and properly treating BV is important for your reproductive health. Seeking care from your doctor is the best way to get the right diagnosis and treatment. I hope this helps provide some reassurance and guidance until you can be evaluated in person.

Initially, it used to happen only in winter 4 to 5 years back and then gradually started in rainy days also. Now in summer also while sweating. It is so irritating like that I am going to be mad. I have stopped using soap and also took Clonafit 0.25 mg and Betonix- 10 prescribed by a dermatologist but there is no improvement. Please help me out of this.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions that may help with your itching:\n\n- It sounds like you may have a condition called cholinergic urticaria, which causes itching and hives when sweating or getting overheated. Antihistamines like cetirizine or loratadine can help block the histamine response that causes itching. Take them daily as prescribed.\n\n- Avoid hot showers/baths. Lukewarm water instead. Pat dry gently after bathing, don't rub. Apply a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer while skin is still damp. \n\n- Wear loose, breathable fabrics like cotton to allow sweat to evaporate and skin to breathe. Avoid wool and polyester that can trap sweat.\n\n- Cool showers, cold compresses, or chilling the itchy area can provide relief. \n\n- Keep fingernails trimmed to avoid scratching and damaging skin. Apply cold packs or topical numbing creams if needed to resist urge to scratch.\n\n- If itching is severe, your doctor may prescribe stronger antihistamines or other medications like leukotriene inhibitors.\n\n- Try to identify and avoid triggers like heat, humidity, sweat, stress, spicy foods, alcohol, etc that make symptoms worse. \n\n- See an allergist for allergy testing if environmental allergies are suspected. Desensitization may help.\n\nLet me know if the itching does not improve in 2-3 weeks on the current treatment. We may need to re-evaluate your skin condition or adjust medications.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please specify the following about the patient's symptoms:\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on your description, it sounds like you have been experiencing some persistent facial tightness and tension, as well as chest burning, over the past few months. While anxiety is certainly a possibility, given the normal test results so far, I would recommend getting evaluated by your primary care doctor for other potential causes.\n\nSome things that could be considered:\n\n- Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction - This can cause tightness and pain in the jaw, face, and neck. Your doctor can examine your jaw joint and muscles. Treatment may include splint therapy, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, etc.\n\n- Cervicogenic headache - This is a headache caused by neck issues, like muscle tightness or joint problems. It can cause face and head pain. Your doctor may recommend imaging of the neck, physical therapy, medications, etc.\n\n- Nerve entrapment - Issues like trigeminal neuralgia or occipital neuralgia can cause facial pain and tightness. Evaluation by a neurologist may be needed. \n\n- Bruxism - Clenching or grinding of the teeth, often at night. This can lead to facial tightness and pain. A dentist can fit you for a night guard.\n\n- Stress/anxiety - While it may not be the sole cause, stress and anxiety can certainly exacerbate symptoms like muscle tension. Relaxation techniques, counseling, etc. may help.\n\nI would recommend following up with your primary care physician for a more thorough evaluation. Diagnostic tests like an MRI or CT scan may be considered to look for potential neurological causes. Trying treatments like physical therapy, massage, and anti-inflammatories may also be reasonable. But getting an accurate diagnosis is important, so persistent symptoms should be evaluated further.

She had been treated for TB (tuberculosis) of the abdomen as her ultrasound of abdomen finding was thicken bowel loop. In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition. But, her neuro problem of numbness in her legs and loss of sensation in legs still continues. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, here are a few thoughts:\n\n- Your mother has a complex medical history with tuberculosis, peripheral neuropathy, spinal compression fracture, and possible arthritis. She has been on several medications which seem to provide limited benefit and some may have caused side effects like high blood sugar.\n\n- The numbness and loss of sensation in her legs could be due to the peripheral neuropathy, which may have been caused by the TB treatment. However, spinal compression can also cause similar symptoms. \n\n- Arthritis is a possibility given her age, but should be confirmed with imaging and lab tests. The steroids she was given can help with arthritis pain but have significant side effects especially at high doses for prolonged periods.\n\n- At this stage, I would recommend:\n\n1) Review of all her records by a senior physician who can look at the case holistically.\n\n2) Stop any unnecessary medications to avoid side effects and interactions.\n\n3) Confirm the arthritis diagnosis with imaging and labs. If confirmed, use lower doses of steroids (like prednisolone <10 mg/day) and/or other arthritis drugs under guidance.\n\n4) Evaluate if spine surgery is needed for the compression fracture. Physiotherapy can also help.\n\n5) For neuropathy, medications like pregabalin or duloxetine may provide some relief. Vitamin B12 is also important.\n\n6) Optimize management of other conditions like diabetes. \n\n7) Most importantly, focus on her quality of life, nutrition, preventing falls and pressure sores. Palliative care input can help provide a holistic approach.\n\nI hope this helps provide some guidance on how to approach this complex situation. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

I am taking Afrin spray for an hour and one pill of Sudafed. I developed a similar condition of cold and sinus infection before six months. I had severe clogging of ears. I was given Amoxicillin for five days and Prednisone 5 mg. My ENT doctor examined my ears and told me that there was no issue with the eardrum. He diagnosed it as eustachian tube issue. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions based on the information provided:\n\n- Afrin nasal spray should only be used for 3-5 days maximum to avoid rebound congestion. Since this is a recurring issue, you may want to try using saline nasal spray and nasal irrigation instead for congestion relief.\n\n- Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) can help relieve sinus congestion and pressure. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids when taking decongestants.\n\n- Since you have a history of sinus infections, it would be reasonable to contact your doctor about getting another short course of antibiotics like amoxicillin. A 5-7 day course may help clear up the infection. \n\n- The prednisone you were given before helps reduce sinus inflammation. You could ask your doctor if a brief course would be appropriate again.\n\n- Applying warm compresses over the affected sinuses may also help provide relief. \n\n- Stay hydrated, rest, and consider using a humidifier. Saline nasal sprays can also help keep the nasal passages moisturized.\n\n- If symptoms persist or worsen, follow up with your ENT doctor to rule out any other underlying issues with your sinuses or eustachian tubes. You may need imaging or evaluation of your ears/sinuses.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

Whether this drug is available without doctor\\s prescription? Thank you.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot recommend or provide advice about using medication to induce abortion without medical supervision. If you have concerns about an unplanned pregnancy, I would advise speaking to a licensed healthcare provider about all options in a confidential and nonjudgmental setting. There are risks involved with taking any medication without medical guidance. It's important to discuss your situation openly with a doctor you trust to determine the safest course of action for your wife's health.\n\n## Output (b):\n Where do you live?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My mother is 50 years old. She complains of episodic, sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon. This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother. She has a history of menorrhagia and cycles have become more irregular now. Then, diagnostic D and C was performed last year, which was normal. She will not smoke or drink. She sleeps 4 to 6 hours daily and snores at night.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, here are my thoughts as a doctor:\n\n- The episodic loss of weight bearing ability and falls due to left Achilles tendon issues could indicate tendinitis or a partial tear. I would recommend an ultrasound or MRI to further evaluate. Rest, ice, compression and elevation when symptomatic along with physical therapy exercises may help. \n\n- The knee and hip pain are likely related to osteoarthritis. Weight loss, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and possibly joint injections can help manage the symptoms. X-rays may be needed to assess the extent of arthritis.\n\n- The shoulder stiffness and discomfort with overhead motions could be indicative of rotator cuff tendinitis or impingement. Physical therapy to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles and improve range of motion would be my first recommendation. Anti-inflammatory medication may also provide some relief. \n\n- The kidney stones and lumbar pain are likely related. Staying hydrated is important to prevent recurrent stones. Pain medication can help manage episodic pain flares.\n\n- For constipation, increasing fiber intake, staying hydrated, and over-the-counter laxatives can help. Ruling out any underlying gastrointestinal issues would be recommended.\n\n- Her history of hypertension, irregular menses, and family history of uterine cancer warrant continued close monitoring and age-appropriate cancer screening. Lifestyle modifications for high blood pressure management are encouraged.\n\n- Addressing sleep apnea concerns with a sleep study would be warranted given the snoring and limited sleep duration.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\n## Output (b):\n Does your mother have any other medical conditions?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Soon into using the drugs I developed headaches, dizziness, and nausea. I changed the type of PPI three times but the symptoms persisted. The symptoms included a feeling of pressure above my right ear and behind my right eye. Later, I came off the PPIs and after using over the counter headache painkillers for three days the severity of the headaches eased. But the feeling of pressure remains to this day on the right side of the face. I often feel heavy head or even light-headed with a slight dizziness, often as if I am hung over. The symptoms come and go, but are there every day for differing periods of time. And the constant is this feeling of slight pressure on the right side of my head above the ear and extending sometimes down to the cheek and behind the right eye.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, here are some possible considerations:\n\n- The symptoms of headache, dizziness, and nausea could indicate side effects from the PPI medications. Some common side effects of PPIs include headache, dizziness, nausea, and gastrointestinal issues. It's good that you tried switching PPIs, but the persistence of symptoms suggests an intolerance or adverse reaction.\n\n- The feeling of pressure above the right ear and behind the right eye could point to sinus issues or migraines. PPIs are not known to directly cause these, but may potentially exacerbate underlying conditions. \n\n- Lightheadedness, heavy headed feeling, and slight dizziness could be signs of vestibular dysfunction or imbalance. The vestibular system in the inner ear controls balance and spatial orientation. Disruptions can lead to dizziness.\n\n- Since the symptoms have continued even after stopping PPIs, it suggests there may be an underlying condition that was revealed or triggered by the PPI use. Further evaluation would be recommended.\n\n- I would advise following up with your doctor for a full neurological and ENT exam to check cranial nerves, ears, sinuses, equilibrium etc. Imaging like an MRI may be considered to rule out any structural abnormalities. Vestibular therapy could also help with recalibrating the balance system if an inner ear issue is suspected.\n\nIn summary, the symptoms point to a neurological or inner ear issue that may have been unmasked by PPI use. Seeking specialized care can help determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment options.

He has no bad breath and he was able to have normal food. Can people with trench mouth have no bad breath and is able to eat normal food?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical information to make a diagnosis. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nTrench mouth, also known as acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), is a severe form of gingivitis characterized by painful, bleeding gums and ulcerations. It is caused by a bacterial infection. Symptoms often include bad breath, bleeding gums, gum pain, and rapid gum deterioration. Most people with trench mouth do experience noticeable bad breath. They may also have difficulty eating and swallowing due to the gum pain and swelling. \n\nIf your partner has no symptoms of bad breath, gum pain, or trouble eating, it is unlikely he has trench mouth. However, the only way to know for sure would be for him to see a dentist for an examination. I would recommend both you and your partner visit a dentist regularly for oral health evaluations and cleanings. Practicing good oral hygiene can help prevent many oral infections.

They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22. So everyone on my side of the family has thyroid issues. We were wondering if you could please give us some guidance. Looking to see if we need to eliminate thyroid as a possible cause of his symptoms or if it is worth further pursuit.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it does not appear that your son has clear evidence of a thyroid issue based on his normal thyroid lab results. However, some additional considerations:\n\n- Low-normal thyroid levels, along with symptoms, could indicate mild hypothyroidism in some cases. An endocrinologist may be able to provide more expert interpretation of the thyroid labs.\n\n- Low iodine and selenium levels can impact thyroid function. Optimizing his intake of iodine-rich foods like seafood, dairy, eggs, and iodized salt, as well as selenium-rich foods like Brazil nuts, tuna, and eggs, may help support thyroid function. \n\n- Family history of thyroid disease increases his risk. Continued monitoring of thyroid labs every 6-12 months would be reasonable.\n\n- Anxiety and hyperthyroid symptoms can overlap. Treating the anxiety first, perhaps with counseling and/or medications, may help determine if symptoms improve before pursuing further thyroid testing.\n\nOverall, consulting an endocrinologist could provide helpful guidance on whether further thyroid testing or treatment is recommended based on his specific case. However, his anxiety may be the main driver of symptoms. A balanced approach addressing both potential causes may be warranted. Reassurance and collaborative decision-making can help manage his anxiety around medical care.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of about your son's condition?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Since then, my nose has been blocked and sore.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I understand your concern, but try not to worry too much. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n- It's very unlikely a spider could survive and remain lodged in your nasal cavity. They typically crawl out on their own or get blown out by breathing, sneezing, or nose blowing. \n\n- The blocked and sore feeling is likely due to irritation and inflammation from the spider crawling around in there. Use saline nasal sprays and rinses to help flush out any irritants. Over-the-counter decongestant sprays like oxymetazoline can also help reduce swelling and discomfort.\n\n- If symptoms persist beyond a few days, see your doctor to examine your nasal passages and ensure there is no infection. Rarely, a spider bite inside the nose could cause a localized reaction.\n\n- To ease your mind, you can use a flashlight to look inside your nostrils. If you don't see any spider legs or other obvious foreign body, chances are good it is gone.\n\n- Try not to disturb or poke around in your nose too much, as this can further irritate it. \n\n- Use an antihistamine oral medication like cetirizine if the nasal tissues are swollen and itchy.\n\nLet me know if your symptoms worsen or don't start improving within the next few days. Most likely this will resolve on its own, but it's important to monitor for any signs of infection.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer the question regarding the patient's smoking and drinking habits.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I started with a severe middle ear infection on the right side. Does my MRI show any evidence of mastoiditis, meningitis or a subdural empyema?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical information to make a diagnosis or interpret MRI results. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nThe symptoms you describe - nausea, headache, stiff neck - could potentially indicate meningitis, which is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. \n\nMastoiditis refers to an infection of the mastoid bone behind the ear. This can sometimes occur as a complication of a middle ear infection. Subdural empyema is a collection of pus between the skull and brain, also often resulting from an infection spreading from the ear. \n\nAn MRI would be helpful to look for signs of infection or inflammation in the mastoid bone or membranes around the brain. However, only a licensed medical professional who has examined you and reviewed your MRI could determine if you have mastoiditis, meningitis or a subdural empyema based on your symptoms and imaging. I would recommend following up promptly with your doctor for a full evaluation. Meningitis in particular can be serious if not treated quickly.

It is like a soft pulpy thing. Right now it is small and not causing much pain. When she works too much, she feels a weight on her shoulder and a mild pain like she has lifted a weight. Is that something cancerous?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Without examining your mother or having more medical details, I cannot diagnose her condition or determine if it is cancerous. However, some general advice:\n\n- Any new lump or bump that persists for more than 2-4 weeks should be evaluated by a doctor, especially if it is growing larger and/or becoming painful.\n\n- Soft, pulpy masses can have many causes - some benign like lipomas or cysts, some potentially concerning like a sarcoma. An ultrasound or MRI scan can help characterize the lesion.\n\n- The mild pain with use suggests it may be impinging on tissues like muscles or tendons as it grows. This needs evaluation.\n\n- Shoulder tumors are not as common as breast, skin or lung tumors, but can still be cancerous. Types like sarcomas, lymphomas and metastatic tumors from other organs need ruling out.  \n\n- At her age, getting it fully evaluated and likely biopsied is recommended. Catching concerning lumps early when small gives the best outcomes.\n\nIn summary, I would recommend your mother see her doctor soon for a full examination and imaging like an ultrasound on the area. If it persists or grows, a biopsy may be warranted to determine if it is cancerous. Catching these things early is important. I hope this helps provide some guidance until she can be properly evaluated!

My problem is the teeth has become white for the past few years. The back portion of the teeth has become dark or black. Teeth are quite creamy. Often a bad smell spreads out from my mouth. My mother also suffers from this problem. I use whitening toothpaste but all are in vain. So, please doctor help me and give me a suggestion.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions that may help with your dental issues:\n\n- The whitening or discoloration of your teeth is likely due to enamel thinning or loss. This can happen from genetics, acid erosion from drinks/foods, grinding/clenching, etc. Using a whitening toothpaste is usually not very effective in these cases. \n\n- The dark/black color in the back teeth is likely due to cavities. The creamy appearance of the teeth also points to demineralization and enamel loss. See a dentist soon to get any cavities filled before they worsen.\n\n- The bad breath is most likely caused by the cavities, as they allow bacteria to accumulate and release smelly compounds. Proper brushing and flossing can help temporarily but you need to get the cavities treated.\n\n- At your age, it's important to take good care of your teeth. Brush twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste and floss daily. See your dentist regularly for cleanings and checkups. Limit sugary and acidic foods/drinks which erode enamel.\n\n- Consider using a fluoride mouthwash daily to strengthen enamel. But more importantly, get a dental exam to assess the extent of any cavities or enamel issues. The dentist can recommend the best treatments like fillings, sealants or bonding to restore your teeth.\n\n- Encourage your mother to also see a dentist to get her dental issues addressed. Dental problems often run in families. Catching issues early is important to prevent further decay.\n\n## Output (b):\n What would you like to know, Patient?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

We visited a pediatrician who suggested a dermatologist consultation. I have attached images of the rashes and the prescription. We noticed that it increases in the evenings. Every morning he wakes up with clear skin and during evenings it worsens. He had a fever for two days around the same time it started. He keeps scratching himself. The severity has reduced, but it is not completely gone.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like your son may have eczema. Some key points:\n\n- Appears as red, itchy rashes that worsen in the evening and improve in the morning. This is typical of eczema flares.\n\n- Often starts or worsens with a trigger like an illness/fever. The initial fever could have triggered an eczema flare.\n\n- Located on commonly affected areas like the folds of elbows, behind knees, face and neck.\n\n- Intense itching and scratching.\n\n- Chronic condition that flares up and improves but may not completely resolve.\n\n- Pediatrician recommending dermatology referral also points to eczema.\n\nWithout examining the rash myself, I can't say definitively, but eczema seems most likely. I would follow up with the dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options like topical steroids, moisturizers and anti-itch creams. Identifying and avoiding triggers, as well as keeping the skin moisturized, can help manage flares.

The X-ray shows I have an intraarticular fracture of the right fifth metacarpal with significant ulnar displacement for consideration of ORIF. I went to my local hospital and they did a CT Scan. They sent me home and said to wait for their call to be seen at the Fracture Clinic. I have only buddy taping on my little and next finger. People are telling me it should be strapped or cast right away. I am worried.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you have a broken 5th metacarpal bone in your right hand that is displaced and may require surgery (ORIF - open reduction internal fixation) to properly align the bone fragments. Some key points:\n\n- An intraarticular fracture means the break goes into the joint surface of the metacarpal bone. This makes it more complex.\n\n- Significant ulnar displacement means the broken fragments have shifted towards your pinky side. This needs to be fixed to restore proper alignment. \n\n- The CT scan gives more detail about the fracture pattern to help plan surgery.\n\n- Buddy taping to the 4th finger is reasonable initial treatment to protect the fracture before surgery. A cast/splint may also help but is not absolutely required at this stage.\n\n- Seeing a hand surgeon/orthopedic specialist in the fracture clinic is the next appropriate step to evaluate if surgery is needed, rather than just casting it.\n\n- Surgery would involve realigning the bone and stabilizing it with plates/screws or wiring to hold it in proper position while it heals.\n\nOverall, it sounds like you are receiving appropriate care with close follow up planned. The fracture does likely need fixation based on the displacement seen, but the hospital was reasonable in discharging you with buddy taping while awaiting definitive treatment from the specialists.

It lasted for about four to five days. She then got dengue and on the 14th of this month, had mild spotting for a day and a half. The doctor said it could be the dengue causing the spotting. She has not gotten her periods yet. I have read that there could be bleeding during pregnancy as well.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical details to determine the specific cause of the bleeding your fiancee experienced. However, here are some general possibilities to consider:\n\n- Bleeding/spotting in early pregnancy is common and not always a sign of problems. Mild spotting around the time a period is expected can occur in up to 30% of pregnancies. Heavy bleeding is less common but can also happen.\n\n- Dengue fever can sometimes cause mild bleeding or spotting. The platelet count often drops in dengue, which can lead to increased bruising/bleeding. So it's quite possible the dengue caused or contributed to the mid-cycle spotting.\n\n- Stress, illness, travel, or other factors can sometimes delay a period or cause mild spotting unrelated to pregnancy. \n\n- There are also more serious causes like ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage that can cause bleeding. But there's no way for me to assess that without more details.\n\nThe best advice is for your fiancee to take a pregnancy test now if she has not gotten her expected period. If positive, she should see an obstetrician for evaluation of the bleeding and to start prenatal care. If negative, she can follow up with her doctor about the delayed/irregular bleeding. I hope this provides some general guidance, but please have her see her doctor for proper evaluation and care.

It is only noticeable when I close my left eye, and so I am not sure how long it has taken for this to develop. I am going to see an optometrist and doctor early next week but am currently on the road for work.My main question is that when I look out of the corner of my right eye the blurriness seems to subside and I can see usually. I am wondering if this is a good sign. I have been dealing with severe anxiety the past couple months, and I am worried that might have raised my blood pressure enough to hurt my eyesight.Eyesight when looking with both eyes seems to be normal. I have also noticed floaters in my eyes. Kindly help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, here are a few thoughts:\n\n- The blurriness and floaters in the right eye could potentially indicate some changes or issues occurring within the eye itself. Some possibilities include:\n\n- Early cataract formation. As we age, the lens inside the eye can start to become cloudy, causing blurred vision. Cataracts often start in one eye first.\n\n- Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). The vitreous is the jelly-like substance inside the eye. As we age, it can start to pull away from the retina, causing floaters. This can also cause some visual disturbances. \n\n- Retinal changes. Issues with the retina, like macular degeneration or a retinal tear, could affect central vision.\n\n- Optic nerve problems. Compression, inflammation, or damage to the optic nerve could potentially cause vision changes.\n\n- The fact that your vision seems to improve when looking out of the corner of your eye could indicate a problem with the central vision, like early macular changes. But it's hard to say for sure without an exam.\n\n- Anxiety and blood pressure can potentially contribute to vision issues, but are unlikely to be the sole cause of the symptoms you described.\n\nThe good news is that you already have appointments scheduled with both an optometrist and doctor. They will be able to do a full eye exam and determine the underlying cause. Some of the possibilities above may be treatable if caught early. Try not to worry too much until you can be evaluated - the vision symptoms you described do not necessarily mean you have anything seriously wrong. But getting checked out ASAP is wise.

I am 70 kg, 5\\3\" feet.I am currently experiencing shortness of breath, it started a week ago and never went away even though I am taking lagundi or herbal cough medicine 500 mg three times a day after meal.I also feel like I have a lot of phlegm that I cannot release. It just feels heavy on my right chest that passes through my back. I am having paranoia on having COVID-19, but I am afraid to get checked because I might actually get it from the hospital. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions based on the symptoms you described:\n\n- Shortness of breath and feeling like you have phlegm in your chest could indicate a respiratory infection like bronchitis or pneumonia. COVID-19 is also a possibility, especially with ongoing symptoms. Getting tested is recommended to determine if it's COVID-19 or another infection.\n\n- Try using a humidifier and doing steam inhalation to help loosen mucus and make coughing more productive. Stay hydrated as well. Over-the-counter mucus thinning medications like guaifenesin may also help. \n\n- If symptoms persist or worsen, seeing a doctor in-person is recommended. Many clinics are taking precautions like screening patients and separating sick from well visits to reduce COVID-19 exposure risk. Your doctor can examine you, order tests like a chest x-ray, and provide appropriate treatment.\n\n- If it is COVID-19, most cases in young healthy individuals are mild and can be managed with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter symptom relief. Close monitoring of your symptoms is important to watch for any worsening that may require medical care.\n\n- Try not to panic - take sensible precautions and see a doctor if symptoms are not improving or you have risk factors. With appropriate evaluation and treatment, most respiratory infections can be managed successfully.

I have a sufficient space for it to grow, and it is growing straight. I do not have pain in the tooth and half of the tooth is poking out now. But I have trouble in opening my mouth fully.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions regarding your wisdom tooth that is erupting in the lower left region:\n\n- It's good that you have enough room for the wisdom tooth to come in and that it is erupting straight. This means it likely won't need to be extracted if it continues to erupt normally.\n\n- The trouble with opening your mouth fully is likely due to inflammation and irritation as the tooth pushes through the gums. This is normal. As more of the tooth erupts through the gums, the inflammation should subside and your jaw mobility should improve.\n\n- Use warm salt water rinses and over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed for discomfort. Avoid hard, crunchy foods on that side while the tooth is erupting.\n\n- Monitor for signs of infection like persistent swelling, pain, redness or pus. If you develop any of those symptoms, you may need antibiotics. See your dentist promptly.\n\n- Once the tooth is fully erupted, be sure to keep it clean by brushing and flossing carefully back in that area. Food can easily get trapped around wisdom teeth and cause decay or gum infection.\n\n- Schedule a follow up dental exam in the next few months after the tooth finishes erupting so your dentist can evaluate its position and health. Extraction may still be recommended later on if you develop recurrent infections or decay related to the wisdom tooth.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! Proper eruption and care of wisdom teeth can prevent many future problems.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please note that the patient has answered the following questions:\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I had two I-pills in one month. After the first I-pill, I got withdrawal bleeding after five days. It lasted for four days and the flow was normal. After 14 days of this incident, I again had protected sexual intercourse and took another I-pill after 36 hours. But this time even after 11 days, there is no withdrawal bleeding. Is this because of hormonal imbalance or pregnancy?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical information to determine the exact cause without examining you. However, some general advice:\n\n- Taking emergency contraception like I-pills multiple times in a short period can disrupt your natural hormonal cycle and lead to irregular bleeding. This is likely the cause of your delayed withdrawal bleeding after the second pill. It does not necessarily indicate pregnancy.\n\n- Continue monitoring your symptoms. If you do not get your period within 1-2 weeks of when you expected it, take a pregnancy test. False negatives are possible before a missed period.\n\n- Avoid repeated I-pill usage if possible, as it is not meant for routine contraception. Instead, consider more regular contraceptive options like the pill, patch, ring, etc. \n\n- Make an appointment with your gynecologist if you have further concerns about delayed periods, unusual bleeding, or need advice on contraceptive options. They can examine you and run any necessary tests.\n\nThe lack of withdrawal bleeding is likely due to hormones, but pregnancy cannot be ruled out yet. Follow-up with your doctor if you do not get your period soon. Avoid repeated emergency contraception and practice safe sex.

Is it advisable to wait for one month to be seen by my gynecologist or go to an urgent care right away?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical information to provide specific medical advice. However, in general:\n\n- Vaginal yeast infections are common and can often be treated with over-the-counter antifungal medications. It's a good idea to follow up with your gynecologist if symptoms persist or recur frequently. \n\n- Antibiotics can disrupt the normal vaginal bacteria balance and lead to yeast overgrowth. It's important to take probiotics while on antibiotics to help prevent this.\n\n- A new vaginal discharge after antibiotics could indicate a different type of infection like bacterial vaginosis. It's a good idea to get examined and tested again to determine the cause, especially if symptoms are uncomfortable.\n\n- Seeing your gynecologist is preferred for recurrent infections, but visiting an urgent care is reasonable if you want quicker relief of symptoms or have any concerns.\n\nThe best course of action depends on your specific symptoms and history. Open communication with your doctor is important to determine the right treatment and follow-up plan.

Then had two heart valves repaired and they want to put a stent in. His list of medications does not seem to make sense and although he loves his cardiologist. I do not think he is paying enough attention. I am in the medical field and although I am not a pharmacist or an M.D. I know a little bit about adverse drug reactions. Tell me if this makes sense to you.Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg half pill twice a day, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq once daily, Losartan potassium 25 mg once daily, Warfarin sodium 5 mg once daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg, Digozin 25 mcg once daily and Furosemide 40 mg once daily.I need to know if these medications are fine to take all in one day and if so, I would like to split them into two times a day according to the reactions. I feel that so many medications doing the same thing is redundant and unnecessary and causing problems. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide specific medical advice without examining the patient, but I can offer some general perspectives on the medications listed.\n\n- Many of these medications are commonly prescribed together after a heart attack and stroke. Beta blockers like metoprolol help protect the heart, ACE inhibitors like losartan reduce blood pressure and strain on the heart, statins like atorvastatin lower cholesterol, and anticoagulants like warfarin prevent clots. Diuretics like furosemide reduce fluid buildup.\n\n- The dosages seem reasonable. Splitting higher dose metoprolol and taking some medications once daily is fine. \n\n- There can be interactions, so monitoring kidney function, electrolytes, and drug levels is important. However, these combinations are routinely used together.\n\n- Redundancy in mechanisms can sometimes be helpful to ensure adequate treatment. But side effects should be monitored. \n\n- The regimen overall appears fairly standard post-cardiac events, but specific adjustments would depend on the individual patient's response. I would recommend your father review all medications at each visit and discuss any side effects with his cardiologist. Dose adjustments can always be made.\n\nThe key is close follow-up and monitoring, and open communication with the cardiologist. I hope this general overview is helpful, but please have your father's doctor review his full history and details.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is your father currently taking any other medications?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

The doctor has told me that my ear got affected with fungus and prescribed Otinex ear drops. I continued that for three days. Initially, I got pain and liquid discharge from ears. Now, pain has gone but slight liquid discharge and ear block is still there. Kindly provide suggestions.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions based on the information provided:\n\n- Fungal ear infections (otomycosis) often cause itching, pain, and discharge. Using the Otinex ear drops as prescribed by your doctor was the right thing to do.\n\n- It's normal to still have some residual discharge and feeling of blockage for a few days after starting treatment, as the infection clears up. \n\n- Continue using the Otinex drops as directed for the full course, usually 7-10 days. This allows the antifungal medication time to fully clear the infection.\n\n- Make sure to carefully clean and dry your ears after getting them wet, such as after showering or swimming. This helps prevent recurrence of fungus. \n\n- Do not try to scratch or clean inside the ear canal, as this can worsen irritation and damage the delicate skin. \n\n- If symptoms persist or worsen after completing the full course of drops, contact your doctor again. You may need a refill of the medication, a change to a different antifungal drop, or further examination to rule out other causes.\n\n- Avoid putting cotton swabs or other objects into the ear canal, as this can push debris and fungus deeper inside.\n\n- Follow up with your doctor as recommended to ensure the infection has resolved fully.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

Antihistamines like cetirizine (Zyrtec) are usually the first line treatment, but it can take several weeks for the maximum benefit. \n\n- Getting a blood test is a good next step, as it may help identify any underlying causes like an autoimmune disorder, thyroid issues, etc. This can guide treatment.\n\n- If antihistamines alone don't seem to be controlling your hives, adding in other medications like leukotriene inhibitors (montelukast, zafirlukast) or H2 blockers (famotidine, ranitidine) may help. Steroid pills or creams are also sometimes used for short courses.\n\n- Identifying and avoiding triggers is also important - things like heat, exercise, stress, certain foods, medications, infections, etc can flare up hives. Keeping a symptom diary can help identify patterns.\n\n- For chronic hives, if standard treatments don't work, specialty medications like omalizumab or cyclosporine may be considered under the guidance of an allergist/immunologist.\n\nThe blood test will hopefully provide some useful information to guide next treatment steps. Be patient, it often takes some time to get the hives fully under control.

Now it has been more than 24 hours. She is bleeding continuously with clots and having severe pain. Kindly suggest what to do now for pain and bleeding?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions for your friend's situation:\n\n- Heavy bleeding and cramping is expected after taking mifepristone and misoprostol for a medical abortion. This can last for several hours or up to a few days. As long as she is not soaking more than 2 pads per hour for 2 hours in a row, it is likely a normal part of the process.\n\n- For pain relief, she can take over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Apply a heating pad to the lower abdomen and back. Rest as much as possible. \n\n- Stay hydrated by sipping water, juices, or electrolyte drinks. Eat light, easy to digest foods when feeling up to it.\n\n- If she soaks through more than 2 pads per hour for 2 hours, or has severe pain not relieved by medication, she should seek medical care immediately to rule out excessive bleeding or infection.\n\n- After a medical abortion, she should follow up with her doctor in 1-2 weeks to confirm the pregnancy has passed and there are no complications.\n\n- Let me know if her symptoms become worse or exceed what is expected. Otherwise, the bleeding and cramping should steadily decrease over the next several days as her body recovers. Monitoring her symptoms closely and following up with her doctor is important.\n\n## Output (b):\n How long has your friend been pregnant?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

But as it is not showing any problem so I left it till now. But now I want to go for hydrocele surgery. Also, I want to know any other methods except surgery which can be done to finish hydrocele. Now I am also going to gym and doing some physical exercise there. Is there any problem with it? My age is 27 years, height is 5\\10\" and weight is 83 kg.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions regarding your hydrocele:\n\n- Hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac around the testicle. It often doesn't cause problems or require treatment unless it grows large or becomes uncomfortable. \n\n- Non-surgical options besides surgery include aspiration, which involves draining the fluid with a needle, or sclerotherapy, where a medicine is injected to shrink the hydrocele. However, these methods have a high recurrence rate and surgery is usually more definitive.\n\n- The most common surgery for hydrocele is a hydrocelectomy, where the hydrocele sac is removed through a small incision in the scrotum. This has a good success rate and most men recover fully within a few weeks.\n\n- Doing physical exercise and going to the gym should not cause any issues with a hydrocele as long as there is no pain or discomfort. Wearing proper supportive undergarments during exercise is advisable. Avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity soon after hydrocele surgery as this may impair healing. \n\n- At your age and fitness level, surgery to remove the hydrocele is likely an appropriate option to consider after discussing the pros and cons with your doctor. Make sure you follow all post-op instructions carefully for proper recovery.

I have taken unwanted 72 on the third day morning after having breakfast. But, still, my periods have not yet started. Can you please help me out with the reason behind that?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical information to determine the specific reason for your delayed period. However, here are some general possibilities:\n\n- Pregnancy is a possibility anytime there is unprotected sex. A pregnancy test is recommended to rule this out.\n\n- Emergency contraceptive pills like Unwanted 72 can sometimes cause temporary disruptions to the menstrual cycle, leading to a delayed period. This is not harmful and your cycle should regulate itself within a few months.\n\n- Stress, travel, illness, changes in diet, exercise, or sleep patterns can also delay periods. \n\n- There are many benign causes for a single late or missed period. However, if this becomes a pattern, see your gynecologist to investigate potential underlying causes like thyroid disorders, PCOS, etc.\n\nMy recommendation would be to take a pregnancy test first. If it is negative, wait a few more days and take another one if your period is still delayed. If you continue to have concerns, schedule an appointment with your gynecologist for an evaluation. Try not to stress too much - delayed periods are common and there are many possible explanations, but your doctor can help determine if any further testing is needed.

I then passed what looked like grey muscle and suddenly no more blood. What does that mean or what could it be?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, it sounds like you may have experienced a miscarriage. Passing grey tissue that looks like muscle suggests you passed pregnancy tissue, which can occur with a miscarriage. \n\nSome key points:\n\n- Spotting throughout the month followed by heavy bleeding could indicate a miscarriage, as bleeding patterns change with pregnancy loss. \n\n- Passing grey or tan tissue that looks like muscle or flesh is often pregnancy tissue being expelled during a miscarriage. This tissue was part of the pregnancy. \n\n- A sudden stop in bleeding after passing tissue suggests the miscarriage has completed.\n\nI would recommend following up with your doctor for an examination and confirmation. They can do tests to check hormone levels and make sure the miscarriage has completed. It's important to ensure no pregnancy tissue remains, as that can cause infection. Your doctor can also provide emotional support and guidance for moving forward. I'm very sorry this happened - miscarriages can be difficult physically and emotionally.

He has nasal blockage for the past two weeks. Now, he has developed a fever. His throat and tonsils are swollen. We took him to a doctor. The doctor prescribed him Benadryl 5 ml and Crocin DS 7.5 ml. He has not given any antibiotics. Is it fine? Please suggest.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions based on the information provided:\n\n- The symptoms of nasal blockage, fever, swollen throat and tonsils indicate your son likely has a viral upper respiratory infection. These are often caused by cold viruses and antibiotics are not helpful in treating them. \n\n- The medications prescribed - Benadryl (an antihistamine) and Crocin (acetaminophen/paracetamol) are reasonable to help treat the symptoms of fever, pain, and congestion. \n\n- Antibiotics are generally not indicated for viral infections as they only treat bacterial infections. The doctor likely did not prescribe antibiotics because it appears your son has a virus.\n\n- Make sure your son stays hydrated with fluids like water, juices, or electrolyte drinks. You can also use saline nasal sprays and give him soft, cool foods if his throat is very sore. \n\n- If symptoms worsen or persist beyond 10-14 days, follow up with the doctor to reassess. Signs to watch for include high fever, severe pain, breathing issues, or symptoms that seem to be getting worse instead of better.\n\n- You can give acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever control and pain relief based on dosage for your son's age/weight. Use as directed on the package.\n\nOverall it sounds like appropriate symptomatic treatment for likely viral upper respiratory infection.

I just woke up from a nap, and the vision in my left eye is blurry. It has not cleared up in the past half an hour. Twice over the years, this has happened, and it normalized over a few hours, but I am in a jungle now. So, I would like to err on the side of caution. I have had previous retinal detachments.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you may be experiencing a temporary blurring of vision in your left eye that has happened before and resolved on its own. However, given your history of retinal detachments and current location in the jungle, it would be best to seek medical attention as soon as possible to rule out a new retinal detachment or other eye issue. Some recommendations:\n\n- Seek out the nearest clinic or medical facility to have your eyes examined by a doctor as soon as you can. Retinal detachments require prompt treatment.\n\n- Avoid any strenuous activity or rubbing of your eye in the meantime.\n\n- If vision gets significantly worse, develops new symptoms like flashes of light, or you start to lose vision in the eye altogether, seek emergency medical care immediately. \n\n- Let the doctor know about your history of retinal detachments and current jungle location, as they may want to rule out infection or inflammation as well.\n\n- Follow any other recommendations from the eye doctor once they examine you. They may prescribe eyedrops, suggest rest and avoidance of strenuous activity, or recommend prompt travel to a facility capable of surgical retinal repair if a new detachment is found.\n\nI hope your vision clears up on its own again, but it's wise to get checked out as soon as possible given your medical history and location.

My right hand and right shoulder directly hit the road and cause severe pain on the right side of the abdomen. A local doctor prescribed some medicine and I got relieved from my side pain. I went for an x-ray of the right chest, it was normal. But after 36 hours I am having pain in the right shoulder (scapula) and while sitting, or arising out of bed, or moving hand on the upper side the pain increases a lot. Is it normal or need better medical assistance?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you may have suffered some injuries from your bicycle accident. Here are a few thoughts:\n\n- The pain in your right shoulder and scapula area could indicate a possible fracture, dislocation, or soft tissue injury like a muscle/ligament strain. The fact that certain movements aggravate the pain suggests something is injured.\n\n- While your chest x-ray was normal, x-rays cannot rule out all potential injuries. An injury to your shoulder joint, rotator cuff, or surrounding soft tissues may not show up on a plain chest x-ray.\n\n- Persistent pain 36 hours after the injury, especially with certain motions, warrants further medical evaluation. This could involve more detailed imaging like an MRI or CT scan to get a better view of the shoulder and upper extremity.\n\n- Seeking evaluation from an orthopedist or sports medicine doctor may be helpful. They can do a thorough exam, order appropriate imaging, and determine if you have any fractures, dislocations or soft tissue injuries that need treatment.\n\n- Options like immobilization, physical therapy, or sometimes surgery may be considered depending on the exact injury. But an accurate diagnosis is needed first.\n\nIn summary, I would recommend getting the shoulder re-evaluated by a specialist given the persistent pain. The severity of injury is unclear without a more detailed exam and imaging. Seeking this follow-up care is likely the best way to ensure proper treatment and recovery.

This month: BG 110 mg/dl, GTT one hour 184 mg/dl, two hours 115 mg/dl, morning insulin 5.3 \\xce\\xbcU/ml. Every other blood test within normal ranges. I am male 32 years old 1.86 cm 93 kg 13 to 14 % body fat athletic with healthy nutrition habits. No history of diabetes in the family. Could I be having cancer in pancreas judging from the insulin values you are seeing? I have had many years to do a blood test and with this random one seven months ago. I was told by my doctor that I had to keep monitoring my blood glucose since I could develop diabetes later on, and since I have never had a problem with blood sugar as a kid and no family history of diabetes, I was wondering what might be going on cause insulin levels dropped from my last test and since my diet was pretty much same with healthy choices why is this happening. My doctor for the last seven months kept telling me to calm down and that I do not have anything cause stressing is bad for my blood glucose too. Should I be telling him to get a pancreas MRI done?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the lab results you described, there is no clear indication that you have pancreatic cancer. Here are a few key points:\n\n- Your blood glucose levels are slightly elevated but not dramatically high. They are consistent with prediabetes or early type 2 diabetes, not pancreatic cancer. \n\n- Your insulin levels are not dangerously low. A significant drop in insulin could indicate pancreatic problems, but your levels only went from 6.2 to 5.3 over 7 months, which is a minor change. \n\n- Pancreatic cancer often causes weight loss and appetite changes, which you did not mention. At 93 kg with 13-14% body fat and athletic habits, your weight seems stable.\n\n- You are young for pancreatic cancer, which is rare under age 45. Family history is a risk factor, which you do not have.\n\nOverall, it is good to monitor blood sugars with your doctor over time, but the results you described do not suggest pancreatic cancer as a likely cause. Your doctor's advice to manage stress and maintain healthy habits is sound. Ask about screening for prediabetes/diabetes, but an urgent pancreatic MRI is likely unnecessary based on the information provided. Discuss any persistent concerns with your doctor, but try not to fixate on the worst case scenario without evidence. Monitor for new symptoms, but avoid creating too much self-directed anxiety.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I keep pushing it with my tongue and clenching a bit against it and I just noticed that it has become loose little more. I have my wisdom teeth and I think it might be applying pressure forward on these teeth. I read in a book that day grinding can cause a teeth to loosen, which is easier to treat. There is no pain and the teeth look healthy. I always clench my teeth but it never caused any looseness.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few things I would recommend based on the information you provided:\n\n- It's good you noticed the loose molar early and there is no pain or visible decay. This suggests the tooth loosening is likely due to pressure from your wisdom teeth or clenching/grinding habits.\n\n- Be gentle with the loose tooth. Avoid hard foods like nuts, crunchy raw veggies, etc. that could traumatize it further. Also try to avoid pushing, wiggling or clenching against the tooth.\n\n- Make an appointment with your dentist for an exam. They can evaluate if your wisdom teeth are putting pressure on the molar and if they need to be removed. The dentist can also check for signs of grinding/clenching and recommend a night guard if needed.\n\n- The dentist may try to splint or stabilize the loose tooth to prevent further damage. If it continues to loosen, extraction may be necessary as the bone and ligaments supporting it have been compromised. But with early care, the tooth may tighten back up and be fine.\n\n- Practice good oral hygiene with regular brushing, flossing and cleanings to keep the area clean while the tooth is loose.\n\nThe prognosis is often good for a slightly loosened molar with no pain or decay. But see your dentist soon for an evaluation and guidance on caring for the tooth and addressing any underlying causes.

She has five brown marks, two of them are 2 cm size and the other three of 0.5 cm. They are irregular in shape. Initial two marks appeared when she was 3 months old and now when she is 9 months three more for added that are comparatively light and 0.5 cm of size. Are these birthmarks? Will they fade with the time? Do we need to take any precautions so that they do not increase or get added further? Can we also provide any medication to cure them?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are my thoughts as a medical assistant on your baby girl's skin marks:\n\n- Brown, irregularly shaped skin marks that appeared in early infancy and have increased in number over time are very likely infantile hemangiomas, a type of benign vascular birthmark. They are quite common, especially in girls.\n\n- Most infantile hemangiomas grow for the first 6-12 months and then slowly involute and fade over the next 5-10 years. No treatment is usually needed, unless they are in a problematic location like the eye, grow very rapidly, or ulcerate. \n\n- To monitor them, take photos every few months to compare. Measure any larger ones to ensure they are not expanding rapidly. Watch for ulceration. Seek medical advice if any of these occur.\n\n- No specific precautions are needed to prevent more from appearing or existing ones from expanding. Their growth is unpredictable but self-limited. \n\n- Topical creams are ineffective. Oral propranolol or timolol can speed involution but have risks and should only be used if problematic. Laser, surgery or steroids may be options for problematic lesions but are rarely needed.\n\n- Be patient and let them fade over time. No cure or treatment is required in most cases. If any changes concern you, seek pediatric dermatology advice. But in most babies these are a harmless, common finding.\n\n## Output (b):\n If you are a patient, please provide as much information about your symptoms and conditions as possible.

Some suggestions:\n\n- Continue using the hydrocortisone cream 1-2 times per day for up to 7 days. It can take time to see improvement. Make sure to apply a thin layer to affected areas only.\n\n- Avoid irritants or allergens that may be causing the rash. This may include soaps, detergents, fabrics, lotions, perfumes, etc. \n\n- Take an oral antihistamine like cetirizine or loratadine to help with itching and inflammation.\n\n- Apply a cold compress or take a colloidal oatmeal bath to help soothe itching and discomfort.\n\n- Keep the skin moisturized with a fragrance-free moisturizer, but avoid very greasy ointments which can worsen rashes.\n\n- Use gentle, fragrance-free cleansers and laundry detergents. \n\n- Wear loose, breathable clothing to allow airflow and prevent irritation.\n\n- If symptoms persist or worsen after 7-10 days, make an appointment to see your doctor. You may need a topical steroid or to identify the underlying cause.\n\nLet me know if the rash does not start to improve in a few days with conservative treatment, or if you have any other questions!\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the main concern?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

They started a root canal but then did not finish. I have gone back several times and every time they open up the tooth and insert medicine. My tooth is in agony right now. I am just wondering if this is a standard procedure during a root canal? Should not the dentist remove the nerves so I am not in so much pain? Or is it the standard procedure to fight the infection first and then remove the nerves?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical details to provide specific advice about your dental treatment. However, I can provide some general information about root canals:\n\n- Root canals involve removing the infected or inflamed pulp tissue inside the tooth and cleaning out the root canal system. This is usually done in one or multiple appointments.\n\n- It's common to place a temporary filling and medication inside the tooth between appointments to help clear infection before completing the root canal. But the tooth should not be left open or cause severe pain. \n\n- The goal is to fully clean and shape the canals to remove all infected tissue before sealing the tooth with a permanent filling. This should relieve pain from the infection/inflammation.\n\n- If you are having severe ongoing pain from an open tooth, I would recommend following up promptly with your dentist. Significant pain is not normal and you may need further treatment or evaluation.\n\n- Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion or ask your dentist to explain the reasoning if you have concerns about your treatment plan. Clear communication is important.\n\nI hope this general overview is helpful, but your dentist who has examined you is best positioned to advise on your particular situation and optimal treatment. Let them know about your concerns so they can address the pain and explain what's needed to properly complete the root canal.\n\n## Output (b):\n The doctor is ready to help you.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have pain in the corner of my left eye for the past one year. I went to the doctor, and he gave me Sterdex. I used it and felt better. My pain went away. After a few months, I started to have pain, but it was not so severe as the first time. I wear glasses and lenses, and I am treating my eye allergy with Chibro Cadron 5 ml, and for dry eyes, I use Fluidabak after taking the lens. Whenever I do my yearly eye checkup, my eyesight gets worse because of the pain in the corner, and I am scared about my sight. I do not know whether I use an appropriate medicine to my eye. Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me the same medication. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions based on the information you provided:\n\n- The recurring pain in the corner of your left eye could be due to several causes - dry eyes, allergies, inflammation, infection, etc. Since it keeps coming back, it's important to get a proper diagnosis from an ophthalmologist.\n\n- Sterdex (dexamethasone) is a steroid eye drop that helps reduce inflammation and pain. However, long-term use of steroids can cause side effects like increased eye pressure or cataracts. It's best to use it for short durations under medical supervision.\n\n- Chibro Cadron (ketotifen) is an antihistamine eye drop used for allergic conjunctivitis. It can help if your eye pain is allergy-related. Make sure to use it as prescribed.\n\n- Artificial tears like Fluidabak are useful for dry eyes. However, you may need more intensive dry eye treatments if simple lubricating drops don't help much. Discuss advanced options like punctal plugs, serum eye drops, or medications that increase tear production with your eye doctor.\n\n- It's important to get a comprehensive eye exam every year or two to monitor for any changes in vision, eye pressure, or eye health issues that could be causing your symptoms. Be sure to voice all your concerns to the ophthalmologist.\n\n- If your current medications and doctor are not improving your condition, consider getting a second opinion from another eye specialist. Persistent eye pain should not be ignored.\n\nI hope these tips help provide some guidance. Don't hesitate to follow up with an ophthalmologist to get to the root of your recurring eye pain. Proper treatment can help manage your symptoms and prevent vision issues in the long run.\n\n## Output (b):\n It looks like your doctor is not very clear about the diagnosis.

It showed a hianal hernia 2 cm. I am attaching photos. The doctor took biopsies, said no cancer. I have had breast cancer in the past. I am having pain in the chest when I swallow, and sternum today. Will that subside? Is it from the bleeding? And, can you recommend the best pill to take for this pain, taking Pantoprazole now? And what should I take for this problem, what should I eat? (Can you assure there is no cancer)?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you in person. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nDiscomfort after an EGD with biopsy and polypectomy is common and usually improves within a few days as any inflammation or irritation from the procedure resolves. Using the throat spray or lozenges, taking over-the-counter pain medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and eating soft foods may help manage throat and chest discomfort initially. \n\nIt's reassuring your biopsies showed no evidence of cancer. Follow up with your doctor as recommended to monitor the hiatal hernia. Diet and lifestyle changes like avoiding large meals, not eating before bed, losing weight if overweight, and not smoking can help manage a hiatal hernia. Medications like PPIs are often prescribed as well.\n\nWithout examining you and reviewing your full medical history, I cannot comment on the specific cause of your current symptoms or make recommendations about medications. It would be best to follow up with the doctor who performed your procedure for continuing care instructions and to address any persistent pain or concerns. They can also make sure there are no complications from the EGD. Don't hesitate to seek medical care if your symptoms significantly worsen.

I am 173 cm in height and weighs about 68 kg. I would like to know about testosterone injection if I took it in a small dosage weekly will that help my appearance to be more manly? Even that my appearance is manly but in general my physical built is small compared to other men, my face, hands, legs are small also my voice is feminine.My testosterone level is good. My body is too hairy and I did a testosterone test everything was normal. I know there is a lot of studies that say that testosterone can lead to depression but actually at the age of 21 I was suffering from depression and I took testosterone for a month (to gain muscles), my mood was very good and it actually helped my depression. Also, my sexual life and erection are very good, I do masturbate once or twice every two days and I get an erection easily.Kindly help me with these questions:Will testosterone injections help me be more manly? What is the recommended dose that I have to take monthly? What are testosterone injections made from, are they made from an animal source? Will testosterone affects my personality? Do I have to take it for life? What if after some period I decided to stop will I loose what I gained?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot recommend taking testosterone injections without a proper medical evaluation and diagnosis from your doctor. Testosterone supplementation carries risks and should only be used under medical supervision for diagnosed conditions. I suggest discussing your concerns openly with your doctor. They can review your hormone levels, medical history and symptoms, and determine if testosterone therapy is appropriate for you. There are many factors that contribute to physical appearance and mood. Your doctor can provide personalized guidance on managing any medical or mental health conditions appropriately. I cannot provide specific medical advice without examining you, but I encourage you to focus on overall wellness through proper nutrition, exercise, sleep and managing stress.

Which is better at combating bad breath due to smoking than alcoholic? I am in a hygiene school and want to know whether or not to recommend non-alcohol mouthwash for the complaints of bad breath from smoking. I have recommended tongue scraping, alcoholic mouthwash. Anyways, they are not going to stop smoking or drinking. I was looking at a way to have them not dry out the tissues, but stopping the obvious factors do not seem to be an option.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have medical expertise to provide specific medical advice. However, I can provide some general information about mouthwashes:\n\n- Alcohol-containing mouthwashes may provide better antibacterial activity compared to alcohol-free versions. The alcohol helps kill bacteria that cause bad breath.\n\n- However, alcohol mouthwashes can cause dryness and irritation in the oral tissues, especially with long-term use. This may worsen bad breath over time.\n\n- Alcohol-free mouthwashes are gentler on the oral tissues. They still contain antibacterial ingredients to help freshen breath, just without alcohol.\n\n- For patients who won't stop smoking or drinking, an alcohol-free mouthwash may be better to avoid excessive dryness. Proper oral hygiene like brushing, flossing, and tongue scraping is still important.\n\n- Ultimately, addressing the root causes of bad breath (smoking, drinking, poor oral hygiene) is ideal. But an alcohol-free mouthwash could help manage symptoms while avoiding further irritation in patients unwilling to stop smoking/drinking. Recommending regular dental visits is also advisable.\n\nThe most appropriate mouthwash depends on the individual patient's needs and preferences. There are pros and cons to both types. I'd be happy to discuss further, but cannot provide specific medical recommendations without examining the patient.

My eyes still yellow. Is it unlikely hematologist who diagnosed me three years ago misdiagnosed? I do not doubt he knows his stuff. More about me getting worried. I lost weight a couple of months ago. I went very yellow in the eyes. I have always felt tired. I have had gallbladder out four years ago, I bruise easily, I do get little red skin dots at times, menstrual cycles can be irregular and spleen slightly enlarged.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you have legitimate concerns about your diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. Some signs that make me question the diagnosis:\n\n- Persistent jaundice (yellow eyes) is not typical of mild hereditary spherocytosis, which usually causes only intermittent jaundice during illnesses or other stresses. \n\n- Weight loss, fatigue, easy bruising, irregular periods, and spleen enlargement can suggest other possible causes besides spherocytosis, like anemia, liver issues, or other blood disorders. \n\n- The gallbladder removal also makes me wonder if something beyond spherocytosis was going on. Gallstones are more common with hemolytic anemias like spherocytosis, but still unusual in mild disease.\n\nI would recommend discussing these concerns with your hematologist. Additional testing like a complete blood count, reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, LDH, and possibly a repeat red blood cell morphology evaluation may help clarify if spherocytosis is really the main problem. There are many causes for anemia and jaundice, so it's important to explore other possibilities if your current diagnosis does not fully fit your symptoms. Do not hesitate to ask your doctor more questions or seek a second opinion if you remain concerned.

My ovary is bulky with right ovary volume 11.5 cc and left ovary volume 11.2 cc. I am suffering from PCOD. I am under treatment for the past three months. Can I get pregnant naturally?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical information to determine if you can get pregnant naturally. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can make it more difficult, but not impossible, to get pregnant naturally. Some things that may impact your fertility:\n\n- Your age and ovarian reserve. As we get older, our egg supply diminishes, making natural conception more challenging. \n\n- The severity of your PCOS symptoms. Issues with ovulation, hormone imbalances, and insulin resistance can interfere with natural conception, but treatment can help improve these factors.\n\n- Your partner's fertility. Male factor issues may also be playing a role. \n\n- How long you've been trying to conceive. It's generally recommended to seek fertility testing/treatment if you haven't conceived after trying for 12 months under age 35, or 6 months over age 35.\n\nMy advice would be to continue working closely with your doctor. They can monitor your cycles, order tests if needed, and determine if any additional treatments may help optimize your chances. Options like ovulation induction medications, IUI, or IVF may be considered if you don't conceive naturally within a reasonable timeframe. But many with PCOS do eventually conceive without extensive interventions.

I experienced an episode that lasted roughly about two to three minutes where I felt that I could not seem to catch my breath and it felt as if my heart had stopped beating. I checked my heart rate roughly three minutes after the incident and it was at 60 bpm and my oxygen was at 99 % under two weeks ago. I had a routine 24 tape which was clear (ectopic beats picked up but were benign). I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. However, they generally come on during stressful situations. Could this be a panic attack symptom? I also wanted to add that this happened during intercourse (I am a 35-year-old male, height is 174 cm and weight is 100 kg). I look forward to your response and suggestions.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you may have experienced a panic attack during intercourse. Some key features that point to a panic attack include:\n\n- The abrupt onset of symptoms like shortness of breath, feeling like your heart stopped, that lasted 2-3 minutes. Panic attacks typically peak within 10 minutes. \n\n- Checking your vitals afterwards showed your heart rate and oxygen levels were normal. This helps rule out a cardiovascular or respiratory issue as the cause.\n\n- You have a history of anxiety and panic attacks, though not typically during intercourse. Stressful situations can trigger panic attacks. \n\n- The symptoms resolved spontaneously within minutes.\n\nPanic attacks can occur out of the blue, even in situations that are not overtly stressful. The physical exertion of intercourse may have triggered this, along with any performance anxiety. I would recommend following up with your primary care provider to discuss this episode. Ruling out any heart or lung conditions with a physical exam and potentially an EKG would be reasonable. Cognitive behavioral therapy and anti-anxiety medications can also help manage panic attack symptoms if they persist.

My platelet count is at 1314, and my doctors are unable to give me a specific reason for it.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough information about your full medical history and test results to provide specific medical advice. However, I can provide some general information about platelet counts:\n\n- A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. \n\n- A platelet count of 1314 is higher than normal, which is called thrombocytosis. This indicates you have more platelets circulating in your blood than normal.\n\n- Some common causes of thrombocytosis include iron deficiency, infection, inflammation, tissue damage, cancer, and certain medications. It can also occur after surgery or as a rebound after chemotherapy.\n\n- Mild to moderate thrombocytosis often has no symptoms and may resolve on its own. Very high platelet counts over 1 million can increase the risk of abnormal clotting.\n\n- Treatment depends on the underlying cause. If there is no clear cause, doctors may recommend periodic monitoring of platelet levels. Lifestyle changes like quitting smoking and maintaining a healthy weight can also help.\n\nSince your doctors are unsure of the reason for your elevated platelet count, I would recommend following up with them for additional testing or referral to a hematologist. They may want to check things like iron levels, look for inflammation markers, or rule out medication side effects. Getting the exact cause diagnosed is important. I hope this general information is helpful while you undergo further evaluation.

I am 54 years old and my weight is 87 kg. My medications are Metformin 500 mg, Hcl 1500 mg, Istavel 100 mg and Glaritus Insulin 30 units. Even then the sugar levels are 246, 265 and 277 after every three hours today. My creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, T3 and TSH are normal.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts based on the information provided:\n\n- Your blood sugar levels are quite high, even on multiple medications for diabetes. This indicates your diabetes is not well-controlled currently. \n\n- An HbA1c of 9.83% is dangerously high. The goal for most diabetics is less than 7%. This suggests your blood sugars have been running high for some time.\n\n- The high blood sugars despite being on metformin, glimepiride, and insulin indicates you likely need adjustments to your medications to improve control. This should be done in consultation with your managing physician.\n\n- Weight loss would likely help improve your insulin resistance and blood sugar control. Losing even 5-10% of your body weight can make a significant difference.\n\n- Given your longstanding diabetes, complications like retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy should be screened for if not already done. These are best prevented by maintaining good control.\n\n- Dietary modifications to reduce carbohydrate intake, increase fiber, and eat fresh fruits/vegetables may help lower blood sugars. Low glycemic index foods are preferred.\n\n- Increasing physical activity and exercising regularly also helps improve diabetes control.\n\n- You should be monitoring your blood sugars frequently throughout the day and keeping a log. This can help guide medication and lifestyle adjustments.\n\nThe key is working closely with your doctor to optimize the diabetes treatment plan and make both medication and lifestyle changes to improve your blood sugar control. Tight control now will help prevent complications down the road.

My tongue also develops a white coating, that has to be scrapped of daily. I have attached a photo of the same. What are the likely causes?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description and photo provided, it appears you may have a fungal infection called oral thrush. Some potential causes include:\n\n- An overgrowth of the fungus Candida albicans in the mouth. This yeast is normally present in small amounts but can multiply and cause infection if conditions allow.\n\n- Medications like antibiotics, inhaled corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants that can disrupt the normal balance of microbes in the mouth.\n\n- Health conditions that weaken the immune system like diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDS.\n\n- Poor oral hygiene.\n\n- Dentures that don't fit properly and irritate the oral tissues. \n\n- Smoking or vaping.\n\n- Infant exposure during birth from a mother with a vaginal yeast infection.\n\nOral thrush causes creamy white lesions, often with reddened borders, that appear on the tongue, inner cheeks, gums, tonsils, or roof of the mouth. A white coating may also develop on the tongue. The lesions can be painful and make eating difficult.\n\nI would recommend seeing your doctor or dentist for an exam and confirmation of the diagnosis. Oral thrush is generally treated with antifungal medications, either lozenges or oral rinses. Improving oral hygiene and addressing any underlying medical conditions can also help clear up infection and prevent recurrence.

I have no fever or other symptoms. Should I be concerned? I had my atlas which was supposedly two degrees off by an atlas orthogonal chiropractor. I originally went in because of my knee and wrist pain then before I knew it, I was having my atlas adjusted by a machine. My last few days I have been miserable and feeling awful. Exhausted, my lymph nodes are so painful on the sides of my neck I have been in bed all day. I just feel this might be related but I do not know.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you in person, as that would be unethical and irresponsible. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nSwollen and painful lymph nodes after an atlas adjustment can sometimes occur, as lymph drainage from the head and neck area can be affected by changes to alignment in the upper cervical spine. This swelling is often temporary as the body adjusts. \n\nThat said, swollen lymph nodes can also indicate infection or other issues. Fever, fatigue and significant pain are concerning symptoms. I would recommend being evaluated by your doctor as soon as possible, especially if symptoms persist or worsen. They can do an exam, determine if testing is needed, and provide appropriate treatment if an infection or other condition is found.\n\nWhile chiropractic care can be helpful for some, it's important to communicate any new or worsening symptoms to your chiropractor and/or doctor. Never hesitate to seek medical care if you have concerns. Your health and safety should always come first. I hope you are able to find relief soon!

I have had a lot of digestive problems for about two years. I have been diagnosed with candida and dysbiosis but my regular doctor does not seem to know what is wrong with me. I have been very stressed and have suffered anxiety since I was about 16. I was not on any medications and started taking Cymbalta a few months ago.After about three to four days, I started to notice a bit of burning in my feet. I have since stopped taking the Cymbalta about a month ago. My feet seemed fine. Then seven days ago, I have started getting really bad pain in my feet and burning and tickling and pins and needle feelings. I am not diabetic or alcoholic. I have no idea what has brought this on or whether it can be reversed. I am so stressed out. I have to be on my feet for my job for about four and a half hours every morning. Can this be tested to see if the nerve cells are either dead or just damaged and can it be reversed? This feels like it is going to ruin my life. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you are experiencing peripheral neuropathy, which can cause burning, tingling, numbness, and pain in the hands and feet. There are several potential causes, including:\n\n- Medication side effects - Cymbalta (duloxetine) can cause peripheral neuropathy in some people. Stopping the medication was wise, as this may help resolve the symptoms. \n\n- Nutritional deficiencies - Low levels of vitamins B1, B6, B12, E and niacin can contribute to peripheral neuropathy. Getting tested for nutritional deficiencies may be helpful.\n\n- Diabetes - High blood sugar can damage nerves over time. Testing for diabetes/prediabetes through blood work can help rule this in or out.\n\n- Autoimmune conditions - Some autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis increase neuropathy risk. Testing for autoantibodies could be considered.\n\n- Alcohol use - Chronic alcohol use can damage nerves. Since you report no alcohol use, this is less likely.\n\n- Infections - Certain viral infections sometimes trigger neuropathy. Testing for HIV, hepatitis B/C could be done to rule these out.\n\n- Toxic exposures - Heavy metal exposure and some chemotherapies are associated with neuropathy. Your history would not suggest these as likely causes.\n\nI would recommend seeing a neurologist who specializes in peripheral neuropathy. They can do a thorough evaluation, order testing to determine the underlying cause, and discuss treatment options to help manage your symptoms. Some neuropathies improve over time, while others require long-term management. Trying to identify the cause is an important first step.

But it appears only in my arms. I have them on a different arm every morning. I do not have itching, and they are not raised.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, it sounds like you may be experiencing petechiae, which are small red or purple spots on the skin that look like tiny dots or freckles. Here are some notes and recommendations:\n\n- Petechiae are caused by bleeding under the skin, often from damaged capillaries. They can appear due to a variety of reasons including injury, sun exposure, crying/straining, coughing, vomiting, or as a side effect of certain medications. \n\n- Since you mention the petechiae appear on different arms every morning, this makes an underlying medical condition more likely. Some potential causes to consider are:\n\n- Thrombocytopenia - Low platelet count which can lead to excessive bruising or bleeding. This may be seen in conditions like leukemia, aplastic anemia, liver disease, etc. Blood tests can help diagnose.\n\n- Blood clotting disorders - Issues with blood clotting factors can also lead to excessive bruising. Testing of the coagulation system would be recommended.\n\n- Vasculitis - Inflammation of blood vessels can cause leakage of blood under the skin. Testing like ESR, CRP, and autoimmune labs may be considered.\n\n- Medication side effects - Certain medications like corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or NSAIDs can sometimes cause petechiae. \n\n- Infections - Viral infections may also be associated with petechiae, especially if the spots are new or changing day to day.\n\nMy recommendation would be to see your primary care doctor for an evaluation. Blood work and possibly referral to a hematologist may be warranted to determine the underlying cause. In the meantime, avoid any medications that can thin the blood.

After that, I got some tests done, which resulted in CMV IgG positive. Then I got vaccinated for rubella to prevent any casualties in the next pregnancy. Now I want to try and conceive, but just now I got my torch panel done again. And now the HSV IGM is positive with 1.15 range along with CMV and rubella IgG positive. Should I wait or can I try to conceive right now? My husband\\s torch panel also done, nothing abnormal.I am currently under Folic acid and Multivitamin, for now, to conceive faster. And also a homeopathic medicine for migraine.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you in person, as that would be unethical. However, I can provide some general information that may be helpful.\n\nA positive HSV IgM indicates a recent or current HSV infection. Before trying to conceive, it would be reasonable to confirm the diagnosis with your doctor, get tested for the specific type (HSV-1 or HSV-2), and discuss any recommended treatment. Many providers advise waiting until the infection has cleared before attempting pregnancy. \n\nThe CMV and rubella IgG positives indicate past exposure/immunity, which is reassuring regarding those infections. Continuing folic acid is appropriate when trying to conceive, to prevent neural tube defects. \n\nOverall, it would be best to discuss your full history and latest test results with your obstetrician. They can then advise you on any further recommended testing or treatment, as well as the optimal timing for trying to conceive given your history and antibody status. Working closely with your doctor will help ensure you have the healthiest pregnancy possible.

He is 14 months and 1 week old. He has not started to walk by his own but started to crawl since 12 months. Is there a problem with his leg muscle?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your son's development:\n\n- Most children start walking independently between 9-18 months of age. Since your son is 14 months old, he is still within the normal range for taking his first independent steps. There is no set timeline.\n\n- The fact that he started crawling at 12 months is a good sign that he is continuing to meet motor development milestones. Crawling helps build strength and coordination that will prepare him for walking.\n\n- Some potential reasons he isn't walking yet include still building leg muscle strength, being cautious in nature, or increased interest in crawling as his preferred method of mobility right now. None of these necessarily indicate a problem.\n\n- At this age, you can encourage walking by holding both his hands and helping him balance in a standing position, using push toys or other walking aids, and creating a safe environment for him to practice cruising or taking steps. But don't force or rush the process.\n\n- If he is not walking by 18 months, mention it to your pediatrician. They can do an evaluation to rule out any underlying issues with muscles, joints, or nerves. Early intervention can help get him the support he needs. \n\n- In the meantime, keep offering opportunities for standing and cruising while letting your son set the pace. If he seems happy and hitting other milestones, try not to worry too much about the exact timeline. But do bring up any concerns with your pediatrician.\n\n## Output (b):\n Okay, I'm going to need you to answer this question for the doctor.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I went to an ENT specialist four days ago. He told me there is an infection and advised me antibiotic.Now my pain in the tonsil has gone, but I am still feeling something stuck in my left side of the throat where there was tonsil pain. I do not have any problem with swallowing. Kindly advise me the needful.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions based on the information provided:\n\n- It's good that you saw an ENT specialist and have been taking antibiotics for your tonsil infection. Antibiotics usually take several days to fully treat an infection, so it's not unusual to still have some residual discomfort even though the main pain has improved.\n\n- The feeling of something stuck in your throat could be due to swelling and inflammation that hasn't fully resolved yet. This is common with tonsil infections and often takes 7-10 days to completely go away. \n\n- As long as you are able to swallow normally, this sensation should not be anything to worry about. It should continue to improve over the next several days as the infection clears.\n\n- Finish the full antibiotic course as prescribed, even if you are feeling better. This will ensure the infection is fully treated.\n\n- Use throat lozenges and warm salt water gargles to help soothe irritation in your throat. This can provide symptomatic relief.\n\n- Avoid irritants like smoking, yelling, or straining your voice while your throat is still healing.\n\n- If the feeling of something stuck does not improve in the next 3-4 days, or you have trouble swallowing, let your ENT doctor know. Additional evaluation or treatment may be needed.\n\n- Schedule a follow up appointment with your ENT as recommended to ensure the infection has resolved.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! Wishing you a full and speedy recovery.\n\n## Output (b):\n Does the pain in your throat worsen when you swallow?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

These small red pimples create a red area when seen from far away because they are very small and inflamed. It never disappears. My skin always feels stuck and not flexible and with a mildly itchy or burning sensation. No matter how much moisturizer I apply, it does not help. I am using Eucerin atopic control moisturizer and a gel cleanser with Hyaluronan. I even tried using Metronidazole and tea oil, but again it did not help. I have also tried to stop using anything on my face for some days, but it stayed the same. I am 24 years old now, and I never had acne tendencies when I was a teenager, and my skin always looked very smooth. My birth control pill is still the same as it was when I first started taking it, which wad around ten years ago. I do not use steroid creams nor fluoride toothpaste. How can I get rid of this? It was not there before a year. I am attaching a picture of my face. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, it sounds like you may be experiencing perioral dermatitis. This is a common inflammatory rash that occurs around the mouth, nose, eyes and forehead. Some key features of perioral dermatitis include:\n\n- Small red bumps or pimples in the affected areas\n- Mild burning or itching sensation \n- Skin feeling tight or stuck\n- Persistent rash that does not improve with typical acne treatments\n\nSome potential triggers for perioral dermatitis include heavy creams/moisturizers, fluoridated toothpaste, makeup, steroid creams, and hormonal changes. The rash often appears out of the blue in adults. \n\nTo treat it, I would recommend the following:\n\n- Stop using all creams, moisturizers, makeup, and other products on the affected areas. This allows the skin to calm down.\n\n- Use a very gentle cleanser like Cetaphil and lukewarm water only. Pat dry.\n\n- Apply a lightweight fragrance-free moisturizer if needed for dryness. Vanicream is a good option. \n\n- Consider eliminating fluoridated toothpaste for a few weeks to see if it helps. Switch to a SLS-free toothpaste.\n\n- Take oral doxycycline or minocycline antibiotic for 6-8 weeks, which helps reduce inflammation. Topical antibiotics usually don't help. \n\n- Be patient. It can take weeks to months to fully clear. Avoid picking or touching the areas.\n\nSeeing a dermatologist may be helpful as well if it persists.

You advised me not to take contraceptive pills since I have the DIU MIRENA. But I have another question. You are right, I have been feeling my body temperature too high, and my last period almosts last seven days. Here is my question: There are five pills left in the blister, and because of your advice I would like to quit right now from taking pills. Is it alright to stop now or should I finish the pills this month and then stop taking them?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical information to provide specific advice about stopping contraceptive pills. However, some general guidelines are:\n\n- It is usually recommended to finish out the full cycle/pack of birth control pills before stopping, rather than stopping mid-pack. This helps maintain the hormonal levels and effects. \n\n- If you decide to stop the pills now with 5 left in the pack, it should not cause major issues, but you may experience some hormonal fluctuations, spotting/bleeding, or other side effects as your body adjusts.\n\n- Check with your doctor who prescribed the pills to get their recommendation on when to stop. They know your full medical history and can advise you best on stopping the pills with the Mirena IUD in place. \n\n- When transitioning off birth control pills, you may ovulate again within 2-4 weeks. So use back-up contraception if needed. \n\n- Monitor your cycle, symptoms, and any side effects after discontinuing the pills. Contact your doctor if you have concerns.\n\nThe best approach is to consult your prescribing doctor before making any changes to contraceptive medications. Let them know about your symptoms and desire to stop the pills, and follow their recommendations. They can guide you on safely transitioning off the pills while using the Mirena IUD.\n\n## Output (b):\n If the patient is not a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I originally felt the pain after playing lots of baseballs (swinging a baseball bat many times). I have symptoms such as tightness, limited mobility or restricted range of motion, throbbing pain, and sometimes it gets so bad that it became hard for me to even walk or sit! I went to my athletic trainer a month ago, and she told me she thinks it is just an aggravated muscle spasm. So she told me to just give it some rest from the activity that hurt it. So I gave it about a month, in which it seemed there was no pain. But as soon as I tried to do the activity that hurt me in the first place, it went right back to hurting. It would be of great help for any assistance. What should I do now?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are my recommendations based on the information you provided:\n\n- It sounds like you may have an acute lower back muscle strain or spasm. The fact that the pain returned when you tried the aggravating activity again after a month of rest suggests this is a recurring issue. \n\n- I would recommend avoiding any activities that exacerbate the pain, including swinging a baseball bat for now. Apply ice packs to the painful area for 15-20 minutes several times per day to help reduce inflammation. You can also try over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen to help.\n\n- Gentle stretching and exercises to strengthen your core and back muscles may help prevent future episodes. Avoid any aggressive bending, twisting or lifting until the acute pain has resolved.\n\n- If the pain persists beyond a few days of rest and conservative measures, you may benefit from seeing a physical therapist. They can evaluate you further and prescribe specific stretches and exercises tailored to your condition. \n\n- If the pain becomes severe or you develop any neurological symptoms like numbness/tingling, you should be evaluated by a doctor. You may need imaging like an MRI to rule out a disc or nerve issue as the cause.\n\n- Using heat before activity, maintaining good posture, and building core strength can help prevent recurrent back muscle strains. But avoid aggravating activities until the current episode has fully resolved. Let me know if your symptoms persist or worsen.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please help!

She had negative home pregnancy tests, a negative test at the doctor, and had a miscarriage the next day after doctors test. My question is, could it be possible there is another fetus remaining inside? I only ask because we each have one parent that is a twin. Please advise.She thought she was on her period the entire week. Bled for seven days. Sheattributed it to the Plan-b pill she took several weeks back. We hadunprotected sex but I still pulled out. She is on birth control andused a Plan-b pill. How is any of this miscarriage stuffpossible especially after just seeing the doctor the day beforemiscarriage?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining the patient, but I can provide some general information.\n\nIt is possible for there to be a remaining fetus after a miscarriage, especially early on in the pregnancy. However, if she had multiple negative pregnancy tests, including one at the doctor's office the day before her bleeding, it is highly unlikely there is still a remaining fetus. The bleeding she experienced was most likely a miscarriage of a very early pregnancy that the tests were not yet able to detect. \n\nThe facts that you each have a twin parent and had unprotected sex, even with withdrawal, do not change the very low probability of a remaining fetus based on her confirmed negative tests. However, if she experiences prolonged or heavy bleeding, cramping, fever or other concerning symptoms, she should follow up with her doctor to confirm there is no remaining tissue. An ultrasound would be able to confirm if a fetus is still present.\n\nI hope this helps provide some reassurance, but let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n## Output (b):\n How old is your partner?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have had a couple of speech therapy sessions but progress is glacial. I am still hoarse and in pain. I have been on 40 mg of Omeprazole for a month and Gaviscon Double Action for two weeks. I feel like the back of my throat is still swollen and I have pain in the corners of my throat. This only briefly eases when I really do some throat opening exercises. I cannot talk for very long without everything getting sore still. I have been like this since the beginning of the year since I had a chest infection and pneumonia. My mouth is now getting sore from all the Gaviscon tablets as the liquid irritates the corners of my throat. I really do not know what else I can do. I am having panic attacks and starting to feel like the only option is to take my life. I had a post nasal drip for most of the year so far and I am trying to get my salivary glands to work again properly.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I understand this is a very difficult situation. Here are some suggestions that may help provide some relief:\n\n- Continue with the speech therapy. It can take time to see progress, but keep at it. Ask your therapist for vocal hygiene tips and exercises you can do at home as well.\n\n- See an ENT (ear, nose and throat) doctor to evaluate your throat and vocal cords. There may be additional treatments or recommendations they can provide.\n\n- Try an over-the-counter oral anesthetic spray that can numb the throat temporarily and provide pain relief. Use as directed.\n\n- Stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Keeping the vocal cords lubricated can help reduce irritation. \n\n- Try an anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen to reduce swelling and discomfort. Follow dosage instructions.\n\n- Use a humidifier, especially at night, to keep airways moisturized. \n\n- Avoid irritants like smoking, alcohol, caffeine and acidic foods.\n\n- Rest your voice as much as possible. Speak softly, whisper, or use other communication methods.\n\n- Manage stress and anxiety with relaxation techniques. This can help reduce muscle tension.\n\n- See a counselor or therapist to help cope with the emotional impact of this illness. Support is so important.\n\nPlease know there are options and don't lose hope. Keep advocating for your health and communicating with your doctors.

It just got worse. I play soccer and that and the sweat is what was irritating it. So I finally went to the doctor and they prescribed me SMZ, TMP DS. I took it for about a week until I realized I was having a lot of side effects and an allergic reaction especially around my mouth. At first I thought I was just breaking out. Then it was not like sores or blisters. I kept self-treating the rash around my mouth and stopped taking the antibiotics. For a couple days it was gone. I was happy. Then I was in the sun one day for soccer and it was just like another rash but worse. I stayed home from school, did not do anything because I just wanted to get it better. But now it looks really bad. I believe I have perioral dermatitis. It is red patches all around my mouth. It is really dry and scaly, also there are like white-heads around my mouth also but they are not whiteheads. I would try to moisturize it with coconut oil or tea tree oil but I think that is what made it worse.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions based on your description:\n\n- It sounds like you had an allergic reaction to the antibiotics SMZ/TMP (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim). Stopping the medication was the right call once you noticed a rash and other side effects. \n\n- The rash around your mouth does sound consistent with perioral dermatitis. Sun exposure and topical products like coconut oil or tea tree oil can worsen perioral dermatitis for some people. \n\n- I would recommend seeing your doctor again. They can confirm the diagnosis and prescribe a topical antibiotic or topical steroid to treat the perioral dermatitis. Oral antibiotics may also help in some cases. \n\n- In the meantime, stop using any creams/oils on the rash. Use only a gentle, fragrance-free facial cleanser and moisturizer. An over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream can help reduce inflammation and itching. \n\n- Avoid excessive sun exposure, irritants, and picking/touching the rash as this can worsen it. \n\n- Once the perioral dermatitis clears, you may need to use a lower-strength topical steroid for a few weeks to prevent recurrence. \n\nLet me know if the rash persists or worsens even after seeing your doctor again. The calf burn may also need further evaluation and treatment if it's not healing well.

I would like to obtain technical info regarding these results, particularly regarding the infarction. I would appreciate the severity of this infarction and whether it could be a machine error. Could you also tell me by perhaps drawing on the shot what waves and shapes indicate problems?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical expertise to interpret treadmill stress test results. However, I can offer some general suggestions:\n\n- Treadmill stress tests are used to assess how the heart responds to exercise and to look for signs of coronary artery disease. Abnormal results may indicate blockages in the arteries that supply the heart.\n\n- The shape and size of the waves on the graph provide information about blood flow to the heart and heart function. A cardiologist would look for changes in the ST segment, which may indicate lack of blood supply to the heart muscle.\n\n- An \"infarction\" refers to death of heart muscle tissue. This is usually due to a complete blockage of an artery, cutting off blood supply to that region of the heart. The size and location of the infarction affects the severity.\n\n- Machine errors are possible with any test, but a cardiologist would usually repeat the test or follow up with other diagnostic exams before making a definitive diagnosis. \n\n- Without examining the full report and medical history, I cannot interpret the specifics of these results. But in general, an abnormal treadmill stress test would warrant follow-up with a cardiologist to determine the cause and significance of any concerning findings. I would be happy to take a look if you can provide more information.\n\n## Output (b):\n The report indicates that there is an infarction on the left ventricle and that a stress test was performed.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

A normal TSH range is generally between 0.4 - 4.0 mIU/L. A TSH level above the normal range indicates an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). \n\nSome key points about an elevated TSH of 18.64:\n\n- It indicates overt or severe hypothyroidism. The higher the TSH, the more underactive the thyroid gland is.\n\n- Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, feeling cold, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, muscle aches, impaired memory and concentration.\n\n- The elevated TSH signifies the pituitary gland is releasing more TSH to try to stimulate thyroid hormone production, but the thyroid gland is not responding normally. \n\n- Causes can include autoimmune thyroid diseases like Hashimoto's, inflammation of the thyroid, prior radioactive iodine treatment or thyroidectomy, certain medications, iodine deficiency, pituitary disorder, or congenital hypothyroidism.\n\n- Confirmatory tests like Free T4, Free T3, and thyroid antibodies should be checked to evaluate the cause and severity.\n\n- Treatment is levothyroxine, a daily oral thyroid hormone replacement pill, to bring the TSH back to the normal range. Thyroid hormone levels and symptoms are monitored to determine the adequate dosage.\n\nIn summary, yes a TSH of 18.64 indicates hypothyroidism which warrants further evaluation and treatment with a thyroid hormone replacement medication.

Some additional questions:\n\n- How long has the lump been there exactly? Lumps that have been present for many months or longer are less concerning than new lumps.\n\n- Is the lump hard or soft? Hard lumps are more concerning than soft lumps. \n\n- Is it painful? Painless lumps are generally less concerning.\n\n- Have you had frequent sore throats or tonsillitis? Chronic inflammation can sometimes lead to benign reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.\n\n- Have you noticed any other lumps in your neck? Spread to multiple areas raises concern for lymphoma.\n\n- Have you had fevers, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss? These constitutional symptoms may indicate a lymphoma.\n\n- Do you have any significant medical history or risk factors? Prior radiation, environmental exposures, or immunodeficiency increase cancer risk.\n\nWithout examining you and getting more history, it is impossible for me to determine if this is concerning for cancer or not. I would recommend being evaluated by an otolaryngologist (ENT doctor) for a thorough head and neck exam. They may order imaging or a biopsy if concerned. Most lone neck lumps in adults are benign, but it's important to have it evaluated, especially if it persists.

All her life she thought she had a problem with her heart but she went to see a doctor and he said she is in perfect health. She starts shaking and cannot breathe and I am really scared and try to calm her down but she cannot breathe. She cannot stop shaking for at least half an hour. I do not know what to do and I hope you can tell me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions for helping your friend during a panic attack:\n\n- Remain calm yourself. Speak to your friend in a soft, reassuring voice. Anxiety is contagious, so your calm presence will help.\n\n- Encourage them to breathe slowly and deeply. Have them put one hand on their chest and one on their stomach. Guide them to breathe in through their nose, feeling their stomach expand with their inhale. Then have them breathe out slowly through pursed lips. This controlled breathing can help reduce hyperventilation.\n\n- Help ground them. Ask them to look around and name some things they see to bring their focus to the present. Or have them grab onto your hands firmly or touch a textured surface. Physical sensations can distract from the panic attack.\n\n- If possible, move them to a quiet, safe space. Reducing external stimuli can aid in calming down. \n\n- Remind them this will pass. Panic attacks often peak at 10 minutes. Let them know their breathing will regulate and the panic will subside. Time reassurance can be helpful.\n\n- Suggest mental distraction. Have them count backwards from 100, say the alphabet, or name animals. Mental activities can divert their focus away from the anxiety.\n\n- Do not dismiss their fears. Validate that the panic attack is real and frightening, but that they will get through it. Stay positive and reassuring.\n\n- Afterward, encourage them to see a mental health professional to learn long-term anxiety management tools like cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation, or medication if needed. Panic attacks can be overcome with the right help.\n\nI hope these tips help you better assist your friend when they have a panic attack. Staying calm and using grounding techniques can lessen the severity until it passes. Professional mental health guidance can also help prevent future occurrences.\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the patient's age?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Recently, I have elevated AST levels. There is no hepatitis or inflammatory diseases, alcohol, drug use, or fatty liver, or Addison\\s.Liver biopsy showed inflammation, but a resolving process likely attributed to a year long Lyme disease treatment with various pharmaceuticals but discontinued two years ago. Liver enzymes dropped to 50 ALT, but have recently elevated to 130 ALT.At this point, there is no known cause. I was told to continue to wait and see. I would like to take a different approach and determine if there is something my hepatologist is not seeing. The current medications are Lamictal and Gabapentin, Trazodone. I had abdominal CT, abdominal MRI, liver biopsy, ultrasounds, and a significant amount of blood work.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it seems you have had mildly elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) for over 1.5 years, with some fluctuations, along with slight liver enlargement. The extensive workup you have had, including imaging, liver biopsy and blood tests, has not revealed a clear cause. \n\nSome suggestions I would have:\n\n- Repeat blood tests to confirm the enzyme elevations and check other liver tests like bilirubin, albumin, INR to assess liver function. Trending the values can help determine if they are worsening or stable.\n\n- Review all medications and supplements you are taking to see if any can cause liver injury. Lamictal, gabapentin and trazodone are generally well tolerated but all medications should be reviewed.\n\n- Ask about getting tested for other rarer causes of liver disease that may have been missed initially - things like autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis. \n\n- Discuss risk factors like family history of liver disease, any chemical exposures, herbal supplements.\n\n- Get repeat imaging to check if the liver enlargement has changed.\n\n- Discuss whether a repeat liver biopsy is indicated to check for progression.\n\n- See a hepatologist or GI specialist if you have not already, for their assessment and to discuss long term monitoring and management.\n\nThe key is close follow up to monitor trends in liver tests, liver imaging, and to rule out all potential causes. Even if a cause is not found, managing any complications is important.

All were negative. The antibody test I took is not a fourth generation test. Is it conclusive or should I take another test? If I repeat the HIV test after six months what is the chance of staying negative? I am facing the problem like small bumps in the tongue, from the last two days a little bit of pain below ear region and it is a little swollen. Is it due to HIV? I am stressed, scared, full of tension. These are hampering my life. I do not know what to do. Today I am in the 107th day of exposure.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have access to your full medical history or test results, so I cannot provide definitive medical advice in this case. However, I can provide some general information about HIV testing that may be helpful:\n\n- The antibody and PCR tests you have taken so far are the recommended tests for detecting HIV infection. The negative results on multiple tests make HIV infection very unlikely at this point.\n\n- Fourth generation antibody tests can detect infection a little earlier, but based on the timing of your tests, a fourth generation test would not be expected to give a different result. \n\n- Repeat testing at 6 months is recommended to definitively rule out HIV infection. The chance of a test being negative at 6 months after a potential exposure, with multiple prior negative tests, is very high. \n\n- The symptoms you describe of tongue bumps, pain below the ear, and swelling are not specific signs of HIV infection on their own. Many conditions can cause these symptoms. Stress and anxiety could also contribute.\n\n- I would recommend discussing your concerns with your doctor. They can examine you, review your full history and test results, and determine if any additional testing or treatment is needed for your symptoms. Getting accurate information and support can help reduce your stress.\n\nIn summary, while no test can completely rule out HIV infection, your risk based on the negative tests so far appears very low. Continuing to monitor your health and discussing any ongoing concerns with your doctor is advisable. Stress and anxiety can manifest in physical symptoms, so focusing on your mental health is also important. I hope this helps provide some reassurance.

I have never really taken them off. I would sleep with the contact lenses in my eyes and I have started wearing them since I was 13 years old. I would change them, but I would not take them off, and I would go days. My vision gets worse when I go to the eye doctor, but I have not had problems with infections. Recently I noticed that my left eye is red without pain or irritation, but red as the color of the pink eye. I do not know if it is the contact lenses which is causing the redness. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your situation:\n\n- Sleeping in contact lenses or wearing them for extended periods of time is not recommended, as it increases the risk of eye infections, irritation, and other problems. The contacts need to be removed, cleaned, and disinfected regularly.\n\n- The redness in your left eye could potentially be due to overwear of the contacts, irritation, or an infection like conjunctivitis (pink eye). It's difficult to say for sure without examining your eyes. \n\n- I would recommend seeing an optometrist or ophthalmologist to have your eyes evaluated. They can examine your eyes closely, determine the cause of the redness, and check for any damage or issues related to long-term contact lens overwear.\n\n- In the meantime, stop wearing your contacts until your eyes can be examined. Use glasses instead. This will allow your eyes to rest and recover. \n\n- Be sure to properly clean and store your contacts going forward, and do not sleep in them or wear them longer than recommended. Follow your eye doctor's instructions.\n\n- If the redness worsens or you have any eye pain, discharge, or vision changes, see an eye doctor promptly as you may need treatment.\n\nThe key is having your eyes examined to determine the cause and ensure there is no permanent damage from long-term contact lens overuse.

I was doing it too fast, and at one point, I got a sharp pain in my back, near where my ribs meet my spine. Since then, I am also having very sharp pain when inhaling and exhaling, as well as when rotating my torso or neck. Should I need to go for urgent care? Currently, I am taking Zyrtec, Amino acid supplements for energy and muscle recovery, hormonal IUD.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on your description, it sounds like you may have strained or pulled a muscle in your back while working out. Here are my recommendations:\n\n- The sharp pain with breathing and movement suggests you may have injured an intercostal muscle between your ribs. This type of injury needs to be treated carefully to avoid complications.\n\n- Apply ice to the painful area for 15-20 minutes several times per day to reduce swelling and pain. Use a towel between the ice and your skin.\n\n- Take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen to help with pain and inflammation. Follow dosage instructions. \n\n- Avoid any activities that exacerbate the pain until it starts to improve. No heavy lifting, sudden movements, or twisting of your back.\n\n- Consider seeing a physical therapist or chiropractor for evaluation and treatment if the pain persists for more than a few days or gets significantly worse despite rest and medication. They can provide supportive taping or bracing as well.\n\n- Seek urgent care or your doctor right away if you develop any concerning symptoms like high fever, trouble breathing, or neurological issues like numbness or weakness.\n\n- Generally this type of injury improves gradually over 2-4 weeks with conservative treatment. But it's important to avoid aggravating it further in the early stages. Let me know if the pain does not start improving in 3-5 days.

I have seen my period in the second month of last year and miss it up for a further two months. I have seen it again after three months and stopped at the end of that month. But anytime I have sexual intercourse, I will bleed and past lots of blood clots for at least three days and then stop, and I waited for four days. I was good until I had sex again the same bleeding occurs, and there was lots of blood clot. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining the patient, but some possibilities to consider based on the description are:\n\n- Amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) can have various causes including hormonal imbalances, eating disorders, excessive exercise, stress, or medical conditions. A doctor should evaluate amenorrhea to determine the cause.\n\n- Abnormal uterine bleeding outside of regular menstrual cycles could potentially indicate issues like uterine fibroids, polyps, endometriosis, or other gynecological conditions. An ultrasound or other testing may be recommended. \n\n- Bleeding after intercourse along with clotting can sometimes be due to cervical lesions, vaginal dryness, infections, or other cervical/vaginal issues. An exam and pap smear by a gynecologist should be done.\n\n- Pregnancy or miscarriage is also a possibility that should be ruled out.\n\nThe best advice is to make an appointment with your gynecologist for a full evaluation. They can take a medical history, perform an exam, and recommend any testing needed to get to the root of the menstrual irregularities and post-coital bleeding. Proper diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause is important. I hope this helps provide some guidance until you can be properly evaluated, but please see a doctor for an accurate diagnosis and care plan.\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the patient's history of the following?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

The last week I have had constant headaches and periodic blurry vision. I am wondering if this could be a result of not wearing my glasses. How often should I be wearing my glasses? The periodic blurry vision started two weeks ago and one week ago the constant headache started (4 to 6 out of 10). I have seen a few different doctors about it but they are not sure.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your situation:\n\n- Astigmatism can certainly cause headaches and blurry vision if you are not wearing your glasses consistently. The glasses help correct the irregular curvature of your corneas so light focuses properly on the retina. Without glasses, you are likely straining to see clearly.\n\n- For an astigmatism prescription like yours, I would recommend wearing your glasses full time whenever you need clear vision - whether for work, driving, using the computer, watching TV, etc. Take them off when you don't need to see far away.\n\n- The fact the headaches and blurry vision started recently after not having issues suggests it's likely related to inconsistent glasses wear. \n\n- I would wear the glasses full time for at least 2 weeks and see if the headaches and blurry vision improve. If so, it confirms the need for regular glasses wear.\n\n- If the symptoms persist despite consistent glasses wear, I would recommend seeing an optometrist or ophthalmologist again to recheck your prescription and examine your eyes for any other issues. But the glasses are the first step.\n\n- Be sure to voice any concerns about headaches or vision changes to your eye doctor as well. Monitoring for changes is important.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

So, I want to know what is happeing with me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the symptoms you have described, it sounds like you may be experiencing some form of indigestion or dyspepsia. Some potential causes could include:\n\n- Gastritis - inflammation of the stomach lining, often due to irritation from stomach acid. This can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and a burning sensation. \n\n- Peptic ulcer disease - ulcers in the stomach or upper part of the small intestine. This can cause abdominal pain that may feel burning or gnawing, usually felt between meals or several hours after eating.\n\n- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - when stomach acid frequently flows back up into the esophagus. This can irritate the esophagus and cause heartburn, regurgitation, and pain around the stomach/belly button area.\n\n- Food intolerance or allergy - difficulty digesting certain foods due to lack of enzymes or immune reactions can lead to abdominal discomfort after eating the trigger foods.\n\n- Pancreatitis - inflammation of the pancreas, which can cause upper abdominal pain after eating, along with nausea and vomiting.\n\nI would recommend seeing your doctor for an evaluation. They can examine you, ask about your medical history, and potentially order tests (such as blood work, ultrasound, endoscopy) to help determine if one of these conditions is causing your symptoms.

However, kissing and touching the breasts of someone carries some potential risk of certain STIs, especially if there are any open sores or cuts on the mouth or breasts. The risks are lower than with sexual intercourse, but not zero.

I am 5\\7\" in height and140 lbs weight. My dad is 5\\9, and my mom is 5\\1. I would like to at least reach 5\\9 to 5\\10. My diet is exceptional. I am taking a multivitamin, and I do not have any deficiencies. I am thinking of taking 1500 mg of Glucosamine because I read studies concluding that it may help a bit. Would you recommend glucosamine, or something else?Also, do you think I can still reach my height goal? I am worried that I may have stunted my growth. I have had insomnia, depression, and anxiety for four years now. This has affected my life considerably, and I am worried I would not grow to my potential height because of it. I also have not been getting too much calcium and protein because I have been avoiding dairy products. Should I be drinking more milk and if so, how much?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are my recommendations as a doctor:\n\n- At age 17, your growth plates are likely closed or nearly closed, so glucosamine is unlikely to help increase your height significantly. Some small studies show minor increases, but results are inconsistent. Focus on healthy habits rather than supplements.\n\n- With your parents' heights, reaching 5'9\"-5'10\" is a reasonable goal genetically. Lack of sleep, mental health issues, and poor nutrition in your teens may have modestly impacted your growth potential. But you're still likely to reach close to your genetic potential.\n\n- Make sure you're getting adequate calcium and protein from non-dairy sources like leafy greens, beans, tofu, nuts, seeds, and fortified foods. Aim for 1300mg calcium and 60-80g protein daily. Milk can help meet these needs if you tolerate it well. 2-3 servings of dairy may be beneficial.\n\n- Work on sleep, mental health, and nutrition going forward. But don't stress excessively about your height. Focus on developing healthy habits that will benefit you throughout adulthood. Your height is still likely to be near your genetic potential.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My back gets locked when I am standing still. There is too much pain on the right side while sitting on a hard surface. There is also nerve pain after having food sitting on the ground. There is pain only on the right side while using the commode. I am suffering from this pain from the past two years and have not got any relief. Kindly help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, it sounds like you may be experiencing pain from a herniated disc in your lower back. Some recommendations I would have:\n\n- See a doctor for an evaluation. They can do an exam and potentially order imaging like an MRI to get more information about what's causing the pain. \n\n- Try conservative treatments like ice/heat, over-the-counter pain medication, gentle stretches and exercises, and physical therapy. These can often help manage symptoms from a herniated disc without invasive treatments.\n\n- If conservative treatments aren't helping after several weeks, you may be a candidate for an epidural steroid injection to help reduce inflammation around the nerve. \n\n- In severe or persistent cases, surgery like a microdiscectomy may be considered to remove the portion of the disc that is pressing on the nerve. However, this is usually a last resort.\n\nThe most important steps are to get evaluated by a doctor, start some conservative treatments, and avoid activities that aggravate the pain in the meantime. While a herniated disc is a common cause of these types of symptoms, a doctor will be able to provide a definitive diagnosis and customize a treatment plan for you. I hope you are able to find relief soon!

I see a flash of light when I look right to left in the left side of my eye. It is a curve from top to bottom. It happens in daylight, nighttime, and even in the dark with my eyes closed. I move my pupil left to right and see a bright arc of light. I cannot make it stay there, it just flashes as I move my eye balls left to right. Any ideas?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, it sounds like you may be experiencing ocular migraines or retinal detachment. Here are some suggestions:\n\n- Ocular migraines can cause visual disturbances like flashing lights or zigzag lines in one eye. They are usually harmless but if the flashes are accompanied by other symptoms like headache, nausea, or vision loss, see an ophthalmologist right away.\n\n- Retinal detachment is a serious condition where the retina pulls away from the back of the eye. One of the first symptoms is often seeing flashing lights or floaters. This is a medical emergency so you should see an ophthalmologist immediately to examine your retina. \n\n- Other less serious possibilities could be a vitreous detachment or inflammation in the eye. But retinal detachment is the most urgent thing to rule out.\n\nMy recommendation would be to see an ophthalmologist as soon as possible. Describe the flashing lights and get a dilated eye exam. The ophthalmologist can examine your retina closely and determine if it is a detachment or something else. Don't delay, as retinal detachments can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated promptly.

All other reports are normal.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the limited information provided, here are a few observations:\n\n- Hemoglobin is within normal range (normal is around 12-16 g/dL for an adult male, 11-15 g/dL for an adult female). This suggests no anemia.\n\n- Platelet count is normal (normal is 150,000-450,000/mcL). This is reassuring and makes thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis unlikely.\n\n- SGOT (also called AST) is mildly elevated. Normal range is less than 40 U/L. This could indicate some liver injury or inflammation. Potential causes include fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, alcohol use, or medications. Further evaluation would be needed.\n\n- SGPT (also called ALT) is more significantly elevated. Normal is less than 45 U/L. This also points to some type of liver issue. ALT is more specific to the liver than AST. Again, further workup is needed.\n\n- Vitamin D level is low. Normal is considered 30-100 ng/mL. This may indicate vitamin D deficiency which can lead to problems with bone health and potentially other issues if severe. Supplementation may be recommended along with checking vitamin D levels again after treatment.\n\nOverall, the main findings are mild AST elevation, more significant ALT elevation pointing to possible liver injury/disease, and vitamin D deficiency. Additional lab tests, imaging, and clinical evaluation would be needed to determine the exact causes and guide treatment.

I am 173 cm. My mother is 173 cm and father is 189 cm. I had a blood test to determine my HGH levels. The doctor asked me for a testosterone and GH test. The result came back a week later and it said that I had a low HGH level and a 21/42 level testosterone. Is this normal for an 18 year old male? I was devastated that my growth plates were closed, because I also had an x-ray of left hand. My doctor asked me whether I am sexually active. I answered him no. But, I got a doubt regarding erectile dysfunction. Am I suffering from erectile dysfunction? Should I be worried? Is my testosterone too low? How can I increase testosterone? I had torsion three years back and nothing back happened. But, this could be a factor. Another factor may be that I used to hold my mobile phone in my pocket all the time.I am a sprint athlete and have defined leg muscles, but this could be due to my short stature. I have gone for another blood test for GH, just as a follow up and that time I was advised to fast for 14 hours. But, I did not fast during my first blood test. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you in person. However, I would recommend discussing your concerns openly with your doctor. At 18 years old, you are still developing and your hormone levels are changing. Your doctor can interpret your test results, take into account your full medical history, and recommend next steps for evaluating your growth and development. Be honest about any concerns, but trust that your doctor wants to help you be healthy. Together you can come up with a plan to address your questions about height, hormones, and sexual function.

I feel that I am recovering normally from what I was told and what I read. However, the area immediately above my belly button is extremely sore and appears to almost be bulging and is slightly elevated when touched. I did have my follow up and questioned this area and he cited the muscle repair and the liposuction but I wanted to get a second opinion on this and see if anyone has had similar experiences that are normal.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical information to provide specific medical advice about your post-operative recovery. However, I can offer some general suggestions:\n\n- It's normal to experience swelling, bruising, and discomfort after a major surgery like a tummy tuck. The area around and above the belly button is often very tender and swollen early on.\n\n- Elevation and bulging could indicate fluid buildup or swelling. This often improves with time as your body heals. Wearing a compression garment as directed can help.\n\n- If the area is extremely painful, hot, red, or shows signs of infection, contact your surgeon right away. Signs of infection need prompt attention.\n\n- Follow your surgeon's instructions closely for wound care, activity restrictions, compression garment use, etc. This will help your body heal properly.\n\n- Discuss any specific concerns with your surgeon at follow-up appointments. They know your case and what to expect. Don't hesitate to ask questions.\n\n- Give it more time. Six days is still early in the recovery process. Swelling and discomfort often improve gradually over several weeks.\n\nI would recommend discussing it again with your surgeon if you remain concerned. But some swelling and discomfort are expected parts of the healing process after a major abdominal procedure like this. I hope you continue to see improvements with more healing time.

I usually ace my tests because I have a very short term memory, so cramming often makes do. But, I often tend to forget things when my body takes the so-called auto-pilot mode. During these times, I tend to do things with me, not really focusing on doing it because I was thinking of something else. I cannot really recall what exactly happened in a day when nothing special has occurred. I often forget where I put things, even when they are already in front of me, or in my hand. I seem to misplace habitually and it has pertrubed my parents. Now I am wandering if these are early symptoms of Alzheimer\\s. Please reply, and if you want to ask questions about me,feel free.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description you provided, it does not sound like you have early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Here are a few key points:\n\n- Alzheimer's is very rare at your age of 18 years old. It is typically seen in older adults over the age of 65. \n\n- The memory issues you describe sound more consistent with inattentiveness, distractibility and some forgetfulness that can occur in normal brains, especially during the teenage years when the brain is still developing. This does not mean you have a neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's.\n\n- Short term/working memory issues that improve with cramming for tests are not a hallmark of Alzheimer's, where short term memory progressively worsens over time. \n\n- Forgetting where you placed objects or misplacing things can happen normally from time to time, especially when distracted or not paying full attention. This would not be considered a warning sign of Alzheimer's in someone your age.\n\n- Overall, the symptoms you describe are very common in young adults and do not display the progressive pattern of memory loss and cognitive decline that is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. \n\nMy recommendation would be not to worry about the possibility of Alzheimer's at this point. Simple memory aids and techniques to minimize distractions and stay focused may help with the forgetfulness.

I think she also has rheumatoid arthritis. For the past five years, she was managing the pain with anti-inflammatory medicine, Lyrica, Mythycobal, Voltaren injections, herbal creams, etc. You can see the veins in her hands popping out. I also realized that the pain has got worse now.For about 12 months the doctor put her only on Prednisolone 5 mg/day and painkiller when necessary. She was fine till last month but the pain increased in her hands now. In the daytime she is fine and the pain starts mildly in the evening. When she lies down in the bed she gets electrical tingling in her legs by which her sleep gets disturbed. She has undergone several tests last week and I attached them for your reference. She did not consult a rheumatologist yet. What medication can I give to reduce the inflammation and cure her? Her ESR, CPR, and ANA are quite high. The pain in her hands and the tingling in her legs at night are agonizing her life. Kindly provide your expert advice.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, here are some suggestions:\n\n- Rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia often require a rheumatologist to manage treatment. Consulting with one could help optimize your mother's medications.\n\n- Medications that can help reduce inflammation and pain in rheumatoid arthritis include DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) like methotrexate, biologic agents like etanercept or adalimumab, and short-term steroids like prednisolone. \n\n- For fibromyalgia, medications that can help include pregabalin or gabapentin, SSRI antidepressants like fluoxetine, and SNRI antidepressants like duloxetine. Low dose amitriptyline at bedtime may help with sleep and pain. \n\n- Lifestyle changes like low-impact exercise, stress reduction, sufficient sleep, and a healthy diet can also be beneficial.\n\n- If pain is still not well-controlled, consulting a pain specialist may help optimize pain medications and consider additional options like nerve blocks or acupuncture.\n\n- Ongoing monitoring by the rheumatologist is important to assess disease progression and adjust medications accordingly. Be sure to communicate all symptoms at each visit.\n\nThe key is working closely with rheumatology to find the right combination of medications and lifestyle approaches to manage both conditions. I would recommend setting up a rheumatology evaluation soon for a thorough assessment and treatment plan.\n\n## Output (b):\n What medication does your mother currently take?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am currently applying Benzoyl peroxide gel on my acne. It only reduces the inflammation but bumps are not reducing. I also have pigmentation caused by acne before. I only get acne on my cheeks. What may be the reason? I usually get cyst acne bumps on my cheeks. If acne clears, then it comes again. I have red pigmentation caused by acne. Can you recommend a product for acne and after acne has cleared, can you suggest a product for pigmentation? Can you recommend a product for controlling further breakouts? Also, I wanted to know which sunscreen and moisturizer to use?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are my recommendations as a doctor for your acne concerns:\n\n- Acne on the cheeks is often hormonal in nature. Consider seeing your doctor about options like birth control pills or spironolactone if the acne persists despite topical treatments. \n\n- Benzoyl peroxide can help reduce inflammation and bacteria but may not be enough to fully clear acne. Consider adding a topical retinoid like adapalene or tretinoin to help unblock pores and normalize skin cell turnover. Start slow and use only a pea-sized amount to avoid irritation. \n\n- For pigmentation, products with ingredients like vitamin C, niacinamide, azelaic acid or tranexamic acid can help fade marks left behind by acne. Apply these consistently after acne has cleared.\n\n- To control breakouts, use a gentle cleanser twice a day, avoid heavy creams/oils, and use oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer and sunscreen. Look for products labeled \"non-comedogenic.\"\n\n- For sunscreen, use a broad spectrum SPF 30+ and reapply every 2 hours if outdoors. For moisturizer, cerave, cetaphil or la roche posay brands are good options.\n\n- See your dermatologist if acne persists despite using these measures for 2-3 months. Procedures like chemical peels or medications may be needed for stubborn acne.

I am currently getting labs done for hepatitis B Surf Ab Quant, HBsAg screen, hepatitis B virus profile, and panel. I am getting conflicting information on websites and from healthcare professionals that hepatitis B does not ever leave the body but I also read that 98 % of the people who get it cleared the disease from the body. My question is what is the real answer, can I beat the virus and remove it from my body completely leaving only anti-bodies?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you had a past hepatitis B infection that your immune system cleared, as evidenced by the negative HBsAg and positive hepatitis B core antibody tests. Here are a few key points:\n\n- HBsAg is a protein on the surface of the hepatitis B virus. A negative test means this virus surface protein is not detected in your blood, indicating you do not have an active hepatitis B infection.\n\n- Hepatitis B core antibody develops after a hepatitis B infection and persists even after the infection resolves. A positive core antibody with negative HBsAg usually indicates a past, resolved infection.\n\n- Yes, the majority of adults (over 90%) who contract hepatitis B are able to clear the infection and develop lasting immunity. The virus does not remain in the body lifelong.\n\n- The additional tests you are getting will help confirm if you have cleared the infection entirely. The hepatitis B surface antibody quantitative test can help determine if you have enough antibody to be protected from future infection.\n\nSo in summary - yes, the majority of adults are able to fully clear hepatitis B infection, with no virus remaining in the body. The positive core antibody indicates you likely had a past infection that your immune system resolved. The additional tests will help confirm if you have complete resolution versus low-level chronic infection.

I do not know what it is? Tonsils are not inflamed, throat a bit dry, and does not hurt to swallow.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you may have some mild irritation or inflammation at the back of your throat. Here are some suggestions:\n\n- It could be related to post-nasal drip or allergies if you have been having any sinus/allergy symptoms lately. Try taking an antihistamine like cetirizine (Zyrtec) or loratadine (Claritin) daily for a few days to see if it improves. Use nasal saline spray or rinses to clear mucus drainage.\n\n- Make sure to stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Dehydration can make throat irritation worse. \n\n- Avoid irritants like smoke, pollution, dry air. Use a humidifier if the air is very dry.\n\n- Gargle with warm salt water several times per day to help soothe the throat. \n\n- Suck on lozenges to lubricate the throat. Look for ones with soothing ingredients like menthol or glycerin.\n\n- Take over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) to reduce pain and inflammation.\n\n- If symptoms persist more than a week or get worse, see your doctor to examine your throat and rule out potential causes like infection. They may test for strep throat or prescribe medications to control irritation.\n\nLet me know if the symptom persists or worsens. Most minor throat irritations resolve on their own, but it's important to follow up if this continues.

I bought it but for some reason, it does not come with usage instructions. How do I use this product but combining it with SPF 30? I would like to know how to use it for a fresh surgical scar. Can someone please tell me how to use it with SPF 30, that is how to combine SPF 30 for a surgical scar because Contractubex does not come with instructions on how to use it mixing it with SPF 30. I had surgery on right cheek to remove the black birthmark.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some tips for using Contractubex and SPF 30 on a surgical scar:\n\n- Clean the scar area gently with mild soap and water, then pat dry. \n\n- Apply a thin layer of Contractubex gel or ointment to the scar. Gently massage it into the skin. \n\n- Allow the Contractubex to fully absorb, usually takes 5-10 minutes.\n\n- Once absorbed, apply an SPF 30 sunscreen liberally over the scar area and surrounding skin. Make sure to rub it in thoroughly. \n\n- Reapply the sunscreen every 2 hours if outdoors or exposed to sunlight through a window. \n\n- Use Contractubex twice daily, once in the morning after cleaning and applying sunscreen, and again in the evening before bed.\n\n- Continue using Contractubex for at least 3 months consistently to see optimal results in reducing scar appearance. It may take 6-12 months for the full effects.\n\n- Always apply sunscreen over Contractubex to protect the sensitive scar tissue from further sun damage. The sun can worsen scarring.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

I am in extreme pain and I am not able to turn my neck to left. When my neck is on right it feels little fine. I cannot do anything with this pain. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions for managing a possible pinched nerve in your neck:\n\n- Rest your neck and avoid any movements that aggravate the pain. Try to keep your neck in a neutral position without bending or turning it. You can support your neck with a soft collar or rolled up towel.\n\n- Apply ice packs to the painful area in your neck and shoulder for 15-20 minutes several times per day. This can help reduce inflammation and pain. \n\n- Take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen to relieve swelling and pain. Follow dosage instructions.\n\n- Do some gentle neck stretches and exercises once the acute pain subsides to improve mobility. Avoid any aggressive neck manipulation.\n\n- Use a heating pad on low setting on the painful areas for 15-20 minutes at a time to relax the muscles.\n\n- Get an appointment with your doctor if the pain persists for more than a few days or gets worse. You may need imaging like an X-ray or MRI to rule out a herniated disc or other injury. \n\n- Physical therapy may be recommended to help strengthen the neck muscles and improve range of motion.\n\n- See a chiropractor for spinal manipulation and mobilization techniques if recommended by your doctor.\n\nThe key is to rest your neck initially to avoid further irritation. But gently mobilize it as soon as you can to prevent stiffness. See a physician if the pain does not improve in a few days.

My sickness started with a slight fever Tuesday night, then Wednesday I got a higher temperature of 38.1. Then Thursday night rashes appeared. I went to a local doctor Friday morning as my fever reach 39 degrees C. They gave me a fast drip to lower my temperature. Then Saturday morning my temperature went down to 37 but I still have few rashes. Then I started feeling my swollen joint, hands, and feet pain. Now I already took a bath as my temperature is 36.3 C. I am just worried about my swollen feet and hands and the pain is troubling.I am currently takin Biogesic Paracetamol.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on your description, it sounds like you may have developed a viral infection earlier this week that led to fever and a rash. The rash, joint pain, and swelling in the hands and feet point towards possible viral arthritis as a complication of the viral illness. \n\nHere are some recommendations:\n\n- Continue taking paracetamol/acetaminophen (Biogesic) as needed for fever control and joint pain. Avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen if the joint pain is due to viral arthritis, as they can worsen inflammation. \n\n- Apply ice packs to swollen joints for 15-20 minutes at a time to help reduce swelling and pain.

It pains more when I press my abdomen. The pain is not very severe, and it comes and goes. I thought it is a gastric pain, so I took medicines for it. But, it did not help me get rid of the pain. What to do now?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of appendicitis. Some recommendations:\n\n- Seek medical attention, as appendicitis can become serious if not treated. Go to the emergency room or urgent care for evaluation.\n\n- Appendicitis often causes pain that starts around the belly button and then shifts to the lower right abdomen. The pain may be constant or come and go. Pressing on the abdomen tends to make the pain worse. \n\n- While antacids may provide temporary relief for gastric issues, they do not treat appendicitis. The appendix is not part of the digestive system, so appendicitis requires different treatment.\n\n- The main treatment for appendicitis is surgery to remove the inflamed appendix. This is usually done laparoscopically, through small incisions. \n\n- Until you can be evaluated, take over-the-counter pain medication like acetaminophen (Tylenol) for some relief. Avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen, as they can worsen inflammation.\n\n- Monitor your symptoms closely and go to the ER if the pain becomes severe, you develop fever, vomiting, or an inability to pass gas/stool. These can indicate a rupture and spread of infection from the appendix.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

The doctor told me it is because of plantar fasciitis. I took four Cortisone injections, and I wear special boots, but I did not get any relief. So, I took an MRI, and I am attaching my MRI reports with this query. What do the results of my MRI mean? I currently take Levoxyl and Paxil. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical expertise to interpret MRI results or provide medical advice. However, I can suggest some general tips that may help with plantar fasciitis pain:\n\n- Continue wearing supportive shoes and consider orthotics or night splints to stretch the plantar fascia while sleeping.\n\n- Apply ice packs to the heel for 15-20 minutes several times per day to reduce inflammation. \n\n- Try over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or naproxen to relieve pain and swelling.\n\n- Perform calf and foot stretches regularly to improve flexibility in the feet and ankles.\n\n- Consider physical therapy exercises to strengthen the foot and improve range of motion.\n\n- Get a second opinion from another podiatrist or orthopedic doctor about other treatment options if conservative treatments are not helping.\n\n- Explore alternative therapies like massage, acupuncture or shockwave therapy.\n\nThe best course of action is to follow up with your doctor, bring your MRI results, discuss your ongoing symptoms, and ask them to explain the findings and recommend next steps based on your full medical history.

I am a vegetarian. I pursue an active lifestyle. I do not smoke or drink. I am a long distance endurance marathon runner. I also strength train three days a week and run two days a week. I got my sugar test, thyroid profile and vitamin D levels checked yesterday. I am attaching the detailed reports, summary as follows:Blood Glucose (F) 89 mg/dL.Blood Glucose (PP) 102 mg/dL.Urine sugar (both in F and PP) not present.HbA1C 5.8 %.Thyroid profile: T3(CLIA) 57 ng/mL, T4(FPIA) 6.38 ug/dL, TSH(CLIA) 1.81 uIU/mL.Vitamin D (25 hydroxycholecalciferol) 26.97 ng/mL.From the reference ranges, things seem to be fine. I just wanted to check with you for any precautions or preventive measures to be taken. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the test results you provided, everything looks within normal limits. As a long-distance runner with a vegetarian diet, here are some suggestions:\n\n- Vitamin D is in the low end of normal range. Since you live an active lifestyle, I would recommend increasing vitamin D intake through foods fortified with vitamin D like milk, yogurt, orange juice as well as getting some sensible sun exposure. You could also discuss taking an over-the-counter vitamin D3 supplement with your doctor. \n\n- Make sure your diet contains sufficient protein, calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin B12 and omega-3s. As a vegetarian, you may need to pay special attention to get adequate amounts of these nutrients through plant-based sources or supplements. \n\n- Stay well hydrated before, during and after exercise to avoid dehydration. Make sure to replenish electrolytes like sodium and potassium that are lost through sweat. \n\n- Listen to your body and allow enough rest and recovery time between intense training sessions to avoid overtraining injuries.\n\n- Get regular check ups to monitor blood counts, electrolytes, kidney function, vitamin levels, etc. Report any unusual symptoms like fatigue, frequent illnesses, etc.\n\nOverall the results are reassuring. With a balanced vegetarian diet and smart training regimen, you seem to be doing everything right to maintain your health and performance.

She has been constantly relying on anti-hypertensive drugs from the past five years and the situation is aggravating day by day. Moreover, she claims of facing high pulse rate and is positively confirmed by ECG. Currently, she consumes a combination of Cilnidipine and Metoprolol and also other allied drugs in an emergency.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have access to medical records or the ability to diagnose. However, I can provide some general information about managing high blood pressure based on the details you have provided.\n\nFor recurrent nocturnal high blood pressure, here are some suggestions that may help:\n\n- Review current medications with the prescribing doctor. Adjusting the timing, doses or adding additional medications at night may help control nighttime spikes. \n\n- Ensure any underlying conditions are well-controlled, like sleep apnea, kidney disease or endocrine disorders. Treating these can improve blood pressure.\n\n- Recommend home blood pressure monitoring at night. This provides helpful data for the doctor to make medication adjustments. \n\n- Suggest lifestyle changes like a low-sodium diet, exercise, stress management and limiting alcohol. These can lower blood pressure overall.\n\n- If blood pressure remains uncontrolled on medications, further evaluation may be needed to check for secondary causes like renal artery stenosis. Procedures or surgery may be options.\n\n- For high pulse rate, medications like beta blockers or calcium channel blockers can help control heart rate. But an ECG and cardiology referral are recommended to check for arrhythmias. \n\nThe most important thing is for your mother to be monitored and treated closely by her physicians. I hope these general tips provide some guidance, but please have her doctor manage her medications and overall care.

MRI before surgery and post-surgery are attached. Biopsy report is also attached. So, kindly help me to understand the biopsy report. Current medications are Encorate Chrono 500 mg twice daily, Thyronorm 50 mg. Current problems are weight loss, severe hair fall, less appetite, weakness, not able to eat or smell non-veg items, no hunger.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Unfortunately I do not have enough medical expertise to interpret biopsy reports or provide medical advice. However, here are a few general tips based on the information provided:\n\n- A craniotomy is a surgical procedure where part of the skull is removed to access the brain. This is often done to remove tumors or blood clots, or to repair aneurysms. \n\n- The biopsy report would provide information about the type of tumor/tissue removed and its microscopic characteristics. This helps determine further treatment. Without seeing the actual report, I cannot interpret the findings.\n\n- Encorate Chrono is an anti-seizure medication, often used after brain surgery to prevent seizures. Thyronorm treats hypothyroidism. \n\n- Symptoms like weight loss, hair fall, loss of appetite could potentially indicate nutritional deficiencies or an underlying condition. Consulting with doctors to rule out causes would be recommended.\n\n- Inability to tolerate smells/tastes can sometimes happen after brain surgery due to nerve inflammation. This often improves with time.\n\nOverall, it would be best to discuss the biopsy findings and ongoing symptoms in detail with your sister's neurosurgeon and other doctors. They can explain the test results and provide specific recommendations about next steps, medications, rehabilitation needs etc based on her complete medical history. I hope she recovers well after the surgery.

Is there any other treatment other than surgery? Please suggest.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical expertise to recommend specific treatments. However, here are a few general notes on femoral neck fractures:\n\n- Non-displaced or minimally displaced femoral neck fractures may be treated non-operatively with protected weight bearing. However, surgery is usually recommended for displaced fractures to prevent complications like non-union.\n\n- Common surgical options include internal fixation with screws/pins or hip replacement surgery depending on the patient's age, fracture pattern, and other factors.\n\n- Nonsurgical management requires strict non-weight bearing and close follow-up to monitor for fracture displacement. Early surgery may be required if the fracture starts to displace. \n\n- Pain management, physical therapy, and addressing risk factors for falls and osteoporosis are also important parts of overall treatment.\n\nThe best course of treatment should be determined by an orthopedic surgeon after thoroughly evaluating your mother's specific fracture pattern, health status, functional demands, and personal preferences. I would recommend consulting an orthopedic surgeon for their professional opinion on the options for your mother. I hope she feels better soon!\n\n## Output (b):\n Can you please tell me your last name and date of birth?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

But we have had unprotected anal sex ten times so far. Can we be infected with HIV?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining the patient. However, I can share some general health information.\n\nHaving unprotected anal sex does carry a risk of HIV transmission, as anal sex is considered a high-risk activity. The risk increases with multiple exposures over time. The only way to know if you have acquired HIV is to get tested. I would recommend both you and your fianc\u00e9e get tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Many clinics provide free and confidential testing services.\n\nIf you test negative, using condoms correctly every time you have sex is the best way to prevent HIV and other STIs. Getting on a regimen of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is another effective strategy for HIV prevention in individuals who are at high risk. I encourage you both to speak with a doctor about your risks and prevention options. Ongoing testing is also important. I hope you are able to have open and honest conversations with each other and your doctor to maintain your health.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer the questions below.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

And it has been about 4 1/2 weeks since my last menstrual period. Unfortunately with labor day being this weekend I have been unable to see my regular OBGYN. But I did go to the ER to confirm the pregnancy 2 days ago. So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth. I have been having bad panic attacks over this and cannot seem to relax as the complications of these medicines are always on my mind. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I understand your concerns about the medications you have been taking during early pregnancy. However, try not to panic or make any hasty decisions. \n\nWhile lorazepam and opioids like percocet do carry some risks if used during pregnancy, the risks are still relatively low, especially if used for a short time and tapered off. At only 1-2 weeks pregnant, the embryo is still very early in development. \n\nMy advice would be to continue tapering off the medications under medical supervision. Do not quit them abruptly, as withdrawal symptoms could be dangerous for both you and the pregnancy. Inform your OBGYN about the medications and dosage you've taken so far. Ask about switching to safer anti-anxiety medications if needed. Stay in close contact with your doctors and attend all prenatal visits. The risks are likely small if the medications are stopped now.\n\nTry relaxation techniques and support from loved ones to help with anxiety. Make healthy lifestyle choices. The chances are still very good that you will have a normal pregnancy and healthy baby. Avoid making any big decisions right now and take it one step at a time. Your doctors can monitor development to help ease your mind. Stay hopeful!\n\n## Output (b):\n Can you give me a reason for the Percocet?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

It comes down from my chest, it kind of fills the gap from under the breast to the ribs. It is not hard, does not hurt nor is it sore. It is just squishy and soft like normal fat. Is it possible to get fat on just one side of the body like that?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, it sounds like you may have a localized fat deposit or lipoma in the area under your left breast. Here are a few thoughts:\n\n- It's quite common to have some asymmetry between the two sides of the body - whether it's in breast size, fat distribution, muscle mass, etc. So it's certainly possible to develop an isolated area of increased fat on just one side. \n\n- Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that can form in various parts of the body. They are soft, movable lumps under the skin, often on the torso/trunk. A lipoma could match your description.\n\n- It's a good sign that the lump is soft, movable, and not painful. This makes cancer very unlikely.\n\n- However, it would be best to get it examined and evaluated by your doctor. They can confirm if it's a benign lipoma through a physical exam and/or imaging like an ultrasound. \n\n- If it is a lipoma and not bothering you, they may just recommend leaving it be. But it's always wise to establish a diagnosis.\n\n- Very rarely, a lump in this area could be related to an underlying breast health issue. So it's best to rule that out.\n\nIn summary, while it may just be an area of localized fat deposit or lipoma, I would recommend having your doctor evaluate it just to be safe. They can then advise you on next steps.

Enamel was removed to make room for the composite resin and the enamel is now too thin and feels sharp to the tongue\\s touch because of this. Shape and feel is not consistent with the natural front right tooth. Is there any way to fix this? Want to be as conservative as possible to avoid further damage.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions that may help improve the dental bonding on your front left tooth:\n\n- Additional bonding material can be added to smooth out the shape and thickness, making it feel less sharp on the tongue. This is a relatively simple and conservative fix. The dentist can add more composite resin to build up the tooth surface.\n\n- If the tooth shape is very uneven or the enamel is very thin, a porcelain veneer may be a better long-term solution. This covers the entire front surface of the tooth with a thin shell. It requires some removal of enamel, but is conservative.\n\n- A crown may be necessary if there is too little enamel left to bond properly. This caps the entire tooth. It's more invasive than veneers or bonding, but will fully correct the shape, feel and function. \n\n- Use a soft toothbrush and gentle brushing technique to avoid damaging the thin enamel. Avoid hard, crunchy, or sticky foods that could fracture it.\n\n- Ask your dentist about options to re-do the bonding or try a veneer/crown. Emphasize you want to be as conservative as possible. With some adjustments and material added, the bonding can likely be improved without further enamel removal.\n\nThe key is to consult your dentist again and communicate your concerns. There are usually good options to adjust dental work and make it more comfortable, while preserving as much natural tooth as possible. I hope this gives you some guidance on how to improve the situation.

But it tore in the middle of the act. But the guy did not ejaculate. I took unwanted 72 within 15 hours. I experienced withdrawal bleeding a week later that was quite normal like a period and lasted for four days. I took UPT which was negative. Can I still be pregnant?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it is unlikely that you are pregnant, but a pregnancy test should be repeated 2-3 weeks after the sexual encounter to be sure. Here are a few key points:\n\n- Using a condom, even if it broke, significantly reduces the risk of pregnancy. As long as the breakage was noticed quickly, some protection was still provided.\n\n- The partner not ejaculating inside you also lowers the risk. \n\n- Taking emergency contraception (Plan B/unwanted 72) within 72 hours further reduces the chance of pregnancy.\n\n- You had withdrawal bleeding around the time of your expected period, suggesting you did not get pregnant that cycle. Bleeding is reassurance you are not pregnant, but not a guarantee.\n\n- The negative pregnancy test is reassuring, but a test could be negative this soon after sex even if pregnant. Retesting in 2-3 weeks provides more definitive results.\n\nTo be absolutely certain, retest for pregnancy 2-3 weeks after the encounter using a sensitive pregnancy test. If that test is also negative, you can be confident you are not pregnant.

I had a surgery three months ago, open myomectomy (posterior wall 4x4 cm subserosal 8x7 cm) with right endometriotic cyst (4x4 cm). Now taking Novelon. Shall I try for a baby now?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining the patient. However, some general considerations after a myomectomy and removal of an endometriotic cyst:\n\n- It is usually recommended to wait at least 3-6 months after surgery before trying to conceive, to allow the uterus time to heal. \n\n- After 3 months, it is reasonable to start trying, but there is still a slightly increased risk of uterine rupture during pregnancy after myomectomy. This risk decreases with time.\n\n- The endometriotic cyst removal may help fertility. However, endometriosis can recur, so if not pregnant within 6-12 months after surgery, further evaluation may be warranted. \n\n- At 29 years old, time is still on your side, but fertility does gradually decline through the 30s. It's reasonable to try for a baby now if desired, but see your OB/GYN for pre-pregnancy counseling to discuss risks, timeline, and recommendations specific to your case. Monitoring through pregnancy may be advised.\n\n- Discuss with your doctor your individual timing and any other relevant factors. With a large myomectomy and endometriosis history, a consultation can help you make the most informed decision about your family planning.

I think it is due to the side effects of Perinorm tablets, which I was taking before six months. I am currently taking homeopathic medicines to remove my glass. Please suggest to me how to get rid of spectacles?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions that may help reduce your dependence on glasses:\n\n- Get a comprehensive eye exam to determine the exact cause of your changing vision. There are many potential reasons for shifts in eyesight, so it's important to understand what's happening.\n\n- If your vision change is due to increasing nearsightedness or farsightedness, you may be a candidate for refractive surgery like LASIK or PRK. These procedures can potentially reduce or eliminate your need for glasses. Discuss the risks and benefits with your ophthalmologist.\n\n- Try vision therapy or eye exercises. These can help strengthen your eye muscles and improve focus. However, evidence on their effectiveness is limited.\n\n- Use over-the-counter reading glasses or computer glasses if you only need vision correction for close tasks. This can reduce reliance on your everyday glasses.\n\n- Take regular breaks when doing near work and use proper lighting to reduce eye strain. This may slow progression of nearsightedness. \n\n- Maintain a healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables. Nutrition can impact eye health.\n\n- Ultimately, glasses are often the simplest and safest solution for vision correction. But the options above may help reduce your need in certain situations. I'd recommend discussing all this with your eye doctor to find the right approach for you.\n\n## Output (b):\n If you are an assistant, then please answer based on the doctor's instructions.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

However, I can provide some general considerations:\n\n- All medications should be used with caution during pregnancy and ideally under the supervision of an obstetrician. Some medications are contraindicated or need dosage adjustments in pregnancy.\n\n- Chymoral Forte contains digestive enzymes (pancreatin) which help improve digestion and nutrient absorption. It is sometimes used short-term for indigestion and heartburn during pregnancy. \n\n- The safety profile of pancreatin in pregnancy is not very well studied. There is limited data showing no increase in birth defects or complications when used for short periods. However, long-term safety is unknown.\n\n- As with any medication in pregnancy, the benefits should be weighed against potential risks. The lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration needed. \n\n- It's best to discuss with your obstetrician before starting Chymoral Forte or any new medication in pregnancy. Share your complete medical history and symptoms to determine if this is an appropriate treatment for you for the recommended duration.\n\nIn summary, short-term use of Chymoral Forte may be considered safe in some cases under medical guidance, but its long-term use in pregnancy cannot be recommended due to lack of safety data.

I have taken Deanxit in the past. Then I stopped it for a year. I started taking it back again six months ago. I have a long flight to take soon. I have a fear of flying. Can I take one pill of Valium 5 mg while taking the Deanxit? So, that I can sleep on the plane. I am taking Femostan Conti, Concor 2.5 for heart palpitations.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you and knowing your full medical history. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nValium (diazepam) and Deanxit (flupentixol/melitracen) are both central nervous system depressants. Combining them increases the risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. It would be best to consult your prescribing doctor before taking them together, especially before a long flight where medical assistance may be limited if you have an adverse reaction. \n\nThere may be safer options to help with anxiety and sleep during flights. Your doctor can consider adjusting your regular medications, prescribing a low dose benzodiazepine specifically for the flight, recommending natural supplements like melatonin, or non-drug approaches like breathing exercises and meditation. They will take your full medical history into account to determine the safest approach for you.\n\nI would recommend discussing your upcoming flight with your doctor. Let them know about your anxiety and desire for sleep aids, along with all your current prescriptions. They can then guide you on the best way to manage anxiety and sleep during the flight while considering potential medication interactions and side effects.

However, some potential causes for black spots on the tongue include:\n\n- Harmless pigmentation changes, like natural aging or racial pigmentation. These are not harmful.\n\n- Oral melanotic macules, which are benign flat pigmented spots. These are also harmless.\n\n- Oral melanomas, which are rare but serious pigmented growths that require medical evaluation.\n\n- Hairy tongue, where the spots are caused by elongation of the papillae on the tongue surface. This is harmless but may indicate poor oral hygiene. \n\n- Oral thrush, a fungal infection that can cause white or black patches or spots on the tongue. Requires antifungal medication.\n\n- Lichen planus, an inflammatory condition that can cause gray or black spots on the tongue. May require treatment.\n\n- Peeling tongue, where dead skin accumulates and leads to discoloration. Improved hygiene helps. \n\n- Medication side effects from things like antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, etc. Discuss with your doctor.\n\n- Heavy smoking, which can cause black hairy tongue. Quitting smoking helps reverse this.\n\nI would recommend seeing your doctor or dentist for an exam and diagnosis.

We have done a urine culture as well as regular analysis and found that there is an infection. She has this problem from a long time. She has a bad habit of holding her urine for a long time until she can hold it no more.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions for your daughter's urinary tract infection:\n\n- It's good that you had a urine culture done to identify the bacteria causing the infection. Make sure she finishes the full course of any antibiotics prescribed to treat the infection.\n\n- Stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids like water and juice. This will help flush bacteria out of the urinary tract. Avoid drinks like soda and coffee that can irritate the bladder. \n\n- Urinate frequently and don't try to hold it for long periods of time. Holding urine allows bacteria to grow and infect the urinary tract. Remind your daughter to use the bathroom regularly throughout the day.\n\n- Consider having her evaluated for any anatomical issues that could predispose her to UTIs, like vesicoureteral reflux. This is when urine flows back up towards the kidneys.\n\n- Encourage proper hygiene after using the toilet. Wipe front to back, avoid bubble baths, and wear cotton underwear.\n\n- Cranberry juice or supplements may help prevent recurrent UTIs by keeping bacteria from adhering to the urinary tract. Discuss this option with her pediatrician.\n\n- If she has frequent UTIs, your pediatrician may recommend low-dose antibiotics as prophylaxis to prevent infection. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

I was told it was found on venous Doppler looking at DVT. What all information can you tell me about the blood vessels having a pulse and it being a cardiac dysfunction? That is all I was left with until the cardiologist consult.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical details to provide specific advice about your personal health situation. However, in general:\n\nCardiac dysfunction refers to problems with the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. It can be caused by issues with the heart muscle, heart valves, or electrical system. \n\nA venous Doppler ultrasound looks at blood flow in the veins to check for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If the veins don't show normal pulsatile flow, it could indicate cardiac dysfunction, as the heart is not pumping blood through the veins effectively.\n\nSome additional information a cardiologist would likely want to know includes any symptoms you are having (chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, etc.), medical history, family history, risk factors, and results of any other cardiac testing that's been done (EKG, echocardiogram, cardiac stress test, etc.).\n\nThe cardiologist will perform a full evaluation to determine the underlying cause and severity of the cardiac dysfunction. Treatment depends on the specific condition but may include medications, surgery, device implantation (pacemaker, ICD), and lifestyle changes.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

My doctor said that I have an umbilical hernia.Either open surgery or laparoscopy, which would be the best? After which surgery, can I lift heavy weights?I am a sports person and a bodybuilder. Please suggest.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions regarding umbilical hernia repair:\n\n- For an umbilical hernia, both open and laparoscopic repair are reasonable options. Laparoscopic repair may have some advantages like smaller incisions and faster recovery, but long-term outcomes are generally similar between the two approaches. The choice often depends on surgeon preference and expertise.\n\n- After either type of repair, it's recommended to avoid heavy lifting for 4-6 weeks to allow the repair to fully heal. Heavy straining or lifting too soon can put pressure on the repair and increase the risk of recurrence. \n\n- After the initial healing period, most patients are able to return to weight lifting and sports without restrictions. However, some experts advise avoiding extremely heavy weights or maximal lifts (like heavy squats or deadlifts) after hernia repairs as a precaution.\n\n- Talk to your surgeon about the specifics of your case, as recommendations may vary. Let them know about your weight lifting goals so they can provide guidance on safely returning to activity after surgery. With proper healing and gradual progression, most patients are able to resume their prior fitness routines.\n\nThe best approach depends on your individual situation. Discuss both surgical options and post-op expectations with your surgeon. They can help you choose the repair method and recovery plan that fits your needs as an active weight lifter.

I have kept putting off seeing the dentist because of a high profile busy job. I have an upcoming appointment but am worried about a possible infection to the bone? If this is the case would I have severe pain and swelling?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you, but I can share some general information.\n\nCavities that are not treated promptly can potentially progress to dental infections, which may involve the pulp inside the tooth or even spread to the bone around the tooth. Signs of a dental infection can include:\n\n- Severe, throbbing tooth pain that is worse with hot or cold foods/drinks. The pain may wake you up at night.\n\n- Swelling of the gums around the infected tooth. The area may be reddened and tender to touch.\n\n- Pus draining from around the tooth. This may have a foul taste/smell. \n\n- Fever, chills, and feeling generally unwell.\n\nHowever, the severity of symptoms can vary. Some dental infections progress slowly with minimal pain. Others cause severe pain and swelling. The extent of infection and bone involvement is best evaluated by your dentist.\n\nSince you have delayed treatment, it's a good idea to see your dentist soon. They can check for signs of infection and take x-rays to assess bone level around the cavities. Prompt treatment including fillings, root canals or tooth extraction is important to prevent the infection from spreading. Good oral hygiene and saltwater rinses may provide some temporary relief until your appointment.\n\nI hope this helps provide some general guidance, but please do follow up with your dentist soon.

I\\m 25 and just had a baby (naturally) 10 months ago. Back pain started at 8 months Postpartum .\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some common causes of one-sided sacroiliac (SI) joint pain that comes and goes in someone around your age and situation:\n\n- Pregnancy - The extra weight and hormonal changes of pregnancy can put increased stress on the SI joints. The pain often starts in the 3rd trimester as the belly gets bigger, and may continue postpartum as the ligaments and joints take time to recover.\n\n- Muscle imbalances - Carrying the extra weight of pregnancy can lead to muscle tightness or weakness on one side, causing uneven forces on the SI joint. The pain comes and goes as the muscles get fatigued. \n\n- Postural changes - Pregnancy alters posture, often increasing lumbar lordosis. After birth, it takes time for the body to regain proper alignment, which can irritate the SI joint.\n\n- Trauma during delivery - Pressure on the pelvis during vaginal delivery, or inflammation from stitches, can aggravate the SI joint on one side. The pain flares up then improves over time.\n\n- Sacroiliitis - Inflammation of the SI joint itself. May be due to hormonal changes or mechanical stress. Comes and goes as the joint gets irritated.\n\n- Referred pain from lumbar spine - Issues with intervertebral discs, facet joints or nerve roots in the lower back can manifest as one-sided SI joint pain.\n\nI would recommend seeing a physical therapist or doctor for an evaluation if the pain persists or worsens. Treatment may include manual therapy, exercises to correct muscle imbalances, postural correction, and anti-inflammatories.

Sadly, I declined rapidly and lost all my hypotheaner and some of my lumbericals in a matter of six weeks. I was operated on exactly 14 weeks ago where I had a decompression of the ulnar nerve and an anterior interosseous nerve transfer to the motor component of the ulnar nerve so that the nerve axons would reach my hand quicker. I still have no improvement and I wanted to ask if it is possible to transfer muscle to fill in the hand? And will this protect my nerves in the hand? Would it be too soon to be considering this operation?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your situation:\n\n- Ulnar nerve entrapment can sometimes lead to rapid muscle atrophy if the compression is severe. It's unfortunate you lost hypothenar and some lumbrical muscle function so quickly. \n\n- The nerve decompression and AIN transfer were good initial steps to try to restore nerve function. Recovery after these procedures can take many months, so it may still be too early to determine if they were successful. I would give it at least 6-12 months before deciding if additional procedures are needed.\n\n- Muscle/tendon transfer procedures can be considered to help restore hand function if nerve recovery remains poor. This typically involves taking a functioning muscle/tendon, like one of the wrist flexors, and re-routing it to restore finger flexion or thumb function.\n\n- Timing for muscle transfers is tricky. If done too early before nerve recovery has plateaued, it can disrupt any nerve regeneration. But waiting too long can lead to muscle fibrosis and poor outcomes from transfers. Most surgeons prefer to wait at least 6 months after nerve surgery before considering transfers. \n\n- The transfers may help protect hand muscles/joints by restoring active motion. But they wouldn't directly protect the nerves themselves. Preventing further nerve damage relies on addressing the underlying compression.\n\nOverall, I would recommend giving your nerve recovery more time before considering muscle transfers. Regular hand therapy and electrostimulation may also help promote nerve regeneration. Follow closely with your surgeon to determine optimal timing of any next steps. I hope this helps provide some guidance as you continue to recover function in your hand. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n## Output (b):\n So you have heard from your doctor that the nerves did not recover.

For the past five months, I am undergoing this treatment. Prior to chemotherapy, I was taking ayurvedic medicine for the same problem. I took the medicine for about eight months, but it did not have any benefit. At that time, I was not aware of the exact problem. I was advised to remove the breast completely, but by the god\\s grace, I was referred to a doctor in oncology. The surgery has not been performed. They started with chemotherapy. Till now, I have completed five cycles. Still, how many cycles are needed for me? Will rest be given to me after the cycles? I am unable to eat, swallow or drink. I have lost my appetite. I have vomiting. Motions are happening from when I start eating my regular diet. I am feeling very depressed and demotivated. I have lost hope from the past five months. My left breast is healing and dressing is done over it. The skin is removed over a part. My breast looks flat as if it is removed. There is itching over the breast.

Now, she is speaking only 3 to 4 words. She is not talking like other children. Please tell me if she has any kind of disorder. I have been to the doctor once and he told nothing to worry. After 2 years only they can speak. But my elder daughter spoke when she was 1.5 years old. I am so worried about her. Please tell me what to do. Her birth weight is 3.2 and now she is around 9 I think.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, here are a few thoughts:\n\n- It's very common for speech development to vary quite a bit between children. Some start talking earlier, some later. At 2 years old, only having 3-4 words is still within the broad range of normal, though on the slower end. \n\n- Since you mentioned your older daughter started talking earlier, around 18 months, it suggests there may be more of an issue for your younger daughter. Comparing siblings can give helpful insight. \n\n- However, many doctors prefer to wait until after 2 years old before evaluating further. There are rapid changes in speech development from 18-24 months.\n\n- If she is otherwise developing well, making eye contact, interacting, and hitting other milestones, I would not be overly concerned yet. \n\n- Check back with your pediatrician at her 2 year appointment. If she has less than 50 words or no 2-word phrases by 24 months, mention your concerns again. They may refer you to a speech therapist for an evaluation. \n\n- In the meantime, keep exposing her to language. Talk to her throughout the day, sing songs, read books. Don't pressure her to speak, but model words and provide a rich language environment.\n\nOverall, while slower speech development can indicate an issue, many toddlers catch up. I would monitor closely, discuss at her next checkup, and provide lots of opportunities to learn language.

She had a fever of about 101.3 the day before yesterday. Our doctor advised her to take Oflox OZ and Sporolac DS. She has had five doses of Oflox OZ till now.The fever has gone and the number of motions has also reduced, though still watery but she is not eating anything. Her appetite is lost and even if she eats a little she complains of nausea though she is not throwing up. I am giving her Emeset for nausea. Is this a normal stomach infection?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your daughter's condition:\n\n- Vomiting and diarrhea lasting 2 days along with fever suggests she likely has some type of viral gastroenteritis. This is often called the \"stomach flu\" and is usually caused by viruses that infect the gut. \n\n- The medications she was prescribed (an antibiotic and probiotic) are reasonable choices for gastroenteritis. The antibiotic can help if bacteria are contributing, and the probiotic can help restore normal gut bacteria.\n\n- It's normal for appetite to remain poor for a few days after gastroenteritis starts. Nausea and vomiting also often persist for 2-3 days. \n\n- Using an anti-nausea medication like Emeset is appropriate to help with nausea and prevent vomiting. This allows rest for her gut.\n\n- As long as she is keeping down fluids and is urinating normally, it's often okay to give the gut a rest from food for a day or two. Clear fluids and bland foods can be introduced as tolerated.\n\n- Most viral gastroenteritis resolves on its own in 3-7 days. But if symptoms persist more than 2-3 days, worsen, or fever returns, further evaluation may be needed.\n\nOverall, it sounds like she is improving appropriately so far. Make sure she stays well hydrated. Call your doctor if symptoms persist or you have any other concerns.

They came back down, and the dentist said they were fine. Now he is 4.5 years old, one of the teeth is ready to fall, and his dentist wants to pull out the other front tooth with a strong root. He says it is best if they both come out at the same time, but did not explain further. Is pulling an absolutely good tooth the best option? I am attaching the x-rays of the teeth.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough information to make a definitive recommendation without examining your son and reviewing his full medical and dental history. However, based on the limited information provided, a few thoughts:\n\n- Trauma to primary (baby) teeth when a child is young can sometimes damage the underlying permanent tooth buds. This may be why your dentist is recommending extracting the healthy-appearing front tooth, if he sees signs of potential damage to the permanent tooth that will replace it. \n\n- It often is ideal for symmetric primary teeth to be lost around the same time so the permanent teeth can erupt properly. So there can be benefits to extracting both front teeth together.\n\n- However, removing an otherwise healthy primary tooth prematurely could negatively impact chewing, speech development, or spacing for the permanent teeth. So it's a tricky balance.\n\nMy suggestions would be to:\n\n- Ask your dentist to explain in detail why he is recommending extracting the healthy-appearing tooth, including showing you the x-rays and examination findings.\n\n- Consider getting a second opinion from another pediatric dentist or orthodontist to see if they agree this is the best course of action.\n\n- See if there are any alternatives to pulling the healthy tooth now, such as monitoring it and waiting until closer to when the permanent tooth erupts.\n\nI hope this helps provide some guidance without being able to fully evaluate your son myself.

My mother had exactly the same disorder like myself. She was diagnosed with an under active thyroid and autoimmune thyroid issue. On taking medication to sort her levels she has been free from the mental health problems.I recently started getting the issue again and took a thyroid function blood test. All levels were within range but my FT3 was slightly elevated at 8.97 pmol /L. I would love an expert opinion on if periodic FT3 level increases could be causing the anxiety, depression, and OCD issues. I am currently on Sertraline 150 mg. Coupled with my mother's exact issue, and cure, I am not sure what these results could mean? What should my next step be and could this elevated FT3 cause my anxiety to start?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it seems like you may be experiencing anxiety and OCD symptoms that could potentially be related to thyroid dysfunction. Some things to consider:\n\n- An elevated FT3 level can sometimes indicate hyperthyroidism, which has been associated with increased anxiety. However, your FT3 is only slightly elevated, so more testing may be needed to fully evaluate thyroid function.\n\n- There does seem to be a familial component, with your mother having similar mental health issues that improved with thyroid treatment. This suggests a possible genetic predisposition.\n\n- The thyroid medication helped your mother, but not everyone with anxiety/OCD has an underlying thyroid issue. The sertraline you're taking can also help with anxiety symptoms for many people.\n\n- Next steps could include discussing further thyroid testing with your doctor to check TSH, thyroid antibodies, etc. A full thyroid panel can give more insight.\n\n- Consulting with a psychiatrist may also be helpful to evaluate if any medication adjustments may be beneficial. Optimizing mental health treatment is important.\n\n- Lifestyle factors like stress management, sleep, diet and exercise can support mental health regardless of thyroid status. A holistic approach can be useful.\n\nThe thyroid connection is certainly worth exploring further given your family history. But anxiety and OCD likely involve multiple factors, so working closely with your doctors to evaluate all potential contributors is recommended. Don't hesitate to advocate for more thorough thyroid testing and a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n## Output (b):\n Before we move on, I have a few questions to ask about your mother's condition.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

It looks like it is in the starting stage of tooth decay. I do not want to lose any teeth. Please advise.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions for dealing with early stage tooth decay:\n\n- See your dentist for an exam. They can assess the extent of the decay and determine if any teeth can still be saved through fillings or other treatments. The sooner you get treatment, the more likely it is that teeth can be preserved.\n\n- Improve your oral hygiene. Brush your teeth thoroughly twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste and floss daily. This removes plaque and bacteria that cause decay. Be sure to brush along the gumline and between teeth where decay often starts.\n\n- Use an antimicrobial mouthwash. Mouthwashes with cetylpyridinium chloride or essential oils can reduce bacteria in the mouth. Use as directed after brushing.\n\n- Limit sugary and acidic foods and beverages. Sugars and acids feed the bacteria that cause tooth decay. Reduce snacking and sipping on things like candy, soda, fruit juice, or lemon water. \n\n- Chew sugar-free gum. Chewing gum increases saliva flow, which helps neutralize acids and wash away food particles. Look for gum with xylitol, which helps prevent decay-causing bacteria from sticking to the teeth.\n\n- Get fluoride treatments. Fluoride strengthens enamel and makes teeth more resistant to decay.

I removed the allergen from my diet and was prescribed Elidel to help clear the rash. However, I experienced over the course of two to three days, white patches which look as there is absolutely no pigment present in these areas. Will hypopigmentation from the use of Elidel fade? I was prescribed Elidel for the first time for a rash on my face. I am pale, but these are extremely white patches reminiscent of acne scars (but being completely flat). Is this likely to be permanent? Will it likely fade? If it may fade, how long would this likely take? What are my potential treatment options? No major injury to the sites was noticed aside from the generalized rash that was being treated.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some thoughts on your situation:\n\n- Hypopigmentation or lightening of the skin is a known possible side effect of using topical immunomodulators like Elidel (pimecrolimus). In most cases, this hypopigmentation is temporary and will improve over time after stopping the medication.\n\n- However, in some cases, the hypopigmentation can persist longer term or potentially be permanent. It's difficult to say for sure in your individual case if the patches will fade or not. \n\n- The good news is that since there was no major injury or scarring to the sites, there is a good chance the pigment may return over weeks to months. I would expect gradual fading over 6-12 months. \n\n- Treatment options if the hypopigmentation persists include topical steroids, topical tacrolimus, laser therapy, dermabrasion or microneedling to stimulate repigmentation. Sun protection is also important.\n\n- I would recommend following up with your dermatologist who prescribed the Elidel to take a look at your skin and provide their expert opinion on your situation. They can best evaluate your individual case and advise on prognosis and treatment options if needed. Being patient and giving it some time to improve on its own is also reasonable.\n\nIn summary, there is a good chance the hypopigmentation may fade gradually over months, but follow up with your dermatologist is recommended. They can guide next steps if it persists.

My sugar level before three months was fasting 180 mg/dl, postprandial 253 mg/dl and HbA1C 8 %. After having medication, the test done a few days back showed fasting 93 mg/dl, postprandial 80 mg/dl, HbA1C 7 %, triglycerides 259 and VLDL cholesterol 51.80. Also, the blood pressure is 200/100 mmHg.I am taking the following medications:Glycomet GP 2 (one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening daily).Galvus 50 (one tablet in the morning daily).Tricinod 10/6.5 (one tablet morning daily).Cilamet XL 50 (one tablet evening daily).Neurokind LC (one tablet afternoon daily).Ecosprin AV 75 (one tablet evening daily).Trika 0.5 (one tablet evening daily).In the past, I was on Met XL 100 (one tablet in the morning daily), Met XL (one tablet in the evening daily), Stamlo 0.5 (one tablet in the morning daily), Ecosprin AV 75 (one tablet evening daily) and Gemer 1 (one tablet morning daily).Currently, my blood pressure is high and feeling heavy on in one side the of head and weak. Kindly suggest whether the medicine given above are correct and whether I can continue with the same or not.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, here are my recommendations:\n\n- Your blood sugar levels have improved significantly which is great. The current medications seem to be working well to control your blood sugars. I would continue the same diabetes medications - Glycomet, Galvus, and Cilamet XL. \n\n- For high blood pressure, the medications may need some adjustment. Tricinod contains a diuretic which can help lower blood pressure. I would recommend increasing Tricinod to twice a day instead of just once. \n\n- Neurokind LC is for nerve pain but doesn't treat high blood pressure, so I don't think it's needed right now. I would discontinue Neurokind for now.\n\n- Ecosprin is an antiplatelet and Trika is a statin for cholesterol. These are appropriate to continue. \n\n- Since your blood pressure is still high, I would recommend adding an ACE inhibitor like Ramipril 2.5-5 mg once a day. This is an additional medication that can help control blood pressure.\n\n- Monitor your blood pressure closely at home. If it remains high >140/90 despite medication changes in 1-2 weeks, you may need further adjustment or an additional medication.\n\n- The headache and weakness could be from high BP. Getting the BP under better control should help. But if symptoms persist, let your doctor know.\n\nIn summary, optimize medications for diabetes and cholesterol. Focus on getting blood pressure under control with adjusted medications. Please consult your doctor to discuss these recommendations.

The first day it was not a high temperature. I had difficulty swallowing and I had a sore throat. Today, the fever is 39.3 Celsius. I had tonsillitis three times before and I have been prescribed Co-amoxiclav, Dequadin, and Strepsils. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions based on the symptoms you described:\n\n- A fever of 39.3C lasting 3 days along with sore throat and difficulty swallowing suggests you may have an infection like strep throat or tonsillitis. Since you've had tonsillitis before, this is likely the case again.\n\n- Co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) is a good antibiotic choice for treating bacterial tonsillitis. Take it as prescribed by your doctor previously. Finish the whole course even if you start feeling better.\n\n- Dequadin and Strepsils can help soothe the sore throat and provide pain relief. Gargle with Dequadin to coat the throat. Suck on Strepsils lozenges to numb the throat temporarily. \n\n- Stay hydrated by sipping cool fluids. Warm teas, broths, and electrolyte drinks can help. Avoid irritating drinks like alcohol, caffeine, and citrus juices.\n\n- Get plenty of rest. Fever requires the body to use extra energy, so extra sleep is important.\n\n- Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever reduction and pain relief. Do not exceed maximum daily doses.\n\n- If symptoms worsen or do not improve in 2-3 days despite antibiotics, you should follow up with your doctor for reevaluation. Difficulty breathing or swallowing are signs to get urgent care.\n\nLet me know if the fever persists or you have any other concerns. Hope you feel better soon!

At time B12 was low started taking it after a couple of months symptoms better. Also, I had regular neuro examination and normal MRI of the head and cervical spine.After a few months, I stopped B12 levels up then a few months after the same symptoms again and B12 low again. Started back on B12 symptoms went away in a couple of months. Last month it started signs yet, but still, on B12 it is very high 1270 so symptoms not due to that. Had another head MRI was normal. My cervical MRI did show moderate to severe changes throughout of narrowing of foraminal in all areas c3 to c7. Also flattening of ventral cord c3 through 6. I am anxious about it being multiple sclerosis.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it seems you have been experiencing intermittent tingling sensations and numbness on both sides of your body, which initially improved with vitamin B12 supplementation. The normal MRI of your brain and recent cervical MRI showing multilevel degenerative changes explain the likely cause of your symptoms. \n\nThe tingling and numbness you describe are most consistent with cervical radiculopathy or nerve root irritation, likely from the moderate to severe foraminal narrowing seen on your cervical MRI. The flattening of your spinal cord is also likely related to these degenerative changes. Multiple sclerosis is less likely given the normal brain MRI and lack of other clinical red flags.\n\nI would recommend continuing the B12 supplements if levels are borderline low. Physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medications may help manage nerve root irritation symptoms. If symptoms worsen or persist, you may need to discuss surgical options to decompress the cervical nerve roots being impinged. But for now, conservative management is reasonable given the MRI findings.

Now, my wife is again pregnant and has completed 26 weeks of pregnancy. She has developed antibodies and the latest ICT with titer test results show 1:64. Last week, we also did sonography and that did not have any impact on the baby.Now, the doctor suggests giving some steroids in this week which will help to develop the baby\\s lungs faster to prevent any complication. Is it safe? If my baby\\s blood group is also negative then are there any possibilities for antibodies to develop in my wife or does the baby\\s blood group does not matter at all? Should I go ahead with NIPT to find the baby\\s blood group?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide specific medical advice without examining the patient, but I can share some general information.\n\n- When a pregnant woman is Rh negative and her baby is Rh positive, the mother's immune system can produce antibodies against the baby's Rh positive blood. This is called Rh incompatibility. It sounds like your wife may have developed these antibodies based on her positive antibody screen.\n\n- An antibody titer of 1:64 is considered moderately elevated. The antibodies can cross the placenta and cause anemia or jaundice in the baby, so monitoring is important. Steroids may be recommended to help the baby's lungs mature faster in case early delivery is required. This is generally considered safe. \n\n- Knowing the baby's blood type from NIPT could be helpful to assess risk, but is not always necessary. The antibodies can affect a Rh positive baby regardless of blood type. \n\n- Even if this baby is Rh negative, there is still a risk of antibody development in future pregnancies if the baby is Rh positive. To prevent this, an injection of RhIg is given after birth and with any sensitizing events like miscarriages or bleeding.\n\nOverall, it sounds like your doctor is taking appropriate precautions. Close monitoring and potential early delivery would be recommended if antibody levels continue to rise.

I do not have any structural or plumbing heart issues. I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row. The EP I saw in the hospital prescribed me Flecainide 50 mg, twice daily. I saw another EP, who was a much older guy, as a second opinion. He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation. I do not agree with him on the ablation due to recent medical studies on WPW and how ablation is recommended even for asymptomatic patients, especially athletes.My question is regarding Flecainide. I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW. Do you think Flecainide at this dosage is safe and reasonable for the next two weeks, until my ablation?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your situation:\n\n- Flecainide can be used to control symptoms in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), but it does not eliminate the risk of developing a dangerous arrhythmia. It's good you're already scheduled for an ablation, which is the definitive treatment. \n\n- The main risk with flecainide is proarrhythmia - meaning it can sometimes promote arrhythmias instead of suppressing them. This risk seems to be fairly low, but is still present. It's good you're only taking it short-term.\n\n- Your low dose of 50mg twice daily is reasonable. I would follow your EP's recommendation on using it until your ablation. It may help control palpitations in the meantime. \n\n- Since you're an athlete, I would avoid strenuous exercise while on flecainide as that can further increase proarrhythmia risk. Stay well hydrated too.\n\n- Be alert for any new symptoms like lightheadedness, rapid heart rate, or fainting while on the medication. Call your EP if any of those occur.\n\n- The ablation has an excellent success rate for curing WPW. After that, you should be able to stop the flecainide and resume normal activities.\n\nIn summary, the short-term use of flecainide appears reasonable in your case to control symptoms until your ablation. Stay in touch with your EP during this time. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n## Output (b):\n I see. So, you have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and you are waiting for an ablation in 17 days.

I just want to know what Depakin are because my old psychiatrist gave me that medicine and I did not use it. It is about 5 months now but I do not feel good these days. I just feel depressed.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your situation:\n\n- Depakine (valproic acid) is an anticonvulsant medication that is also used as a mood stabilizer for conditions like bipolar disorder and major depression. It can be helpful for some people with depression, but needs to be prescribed and monitored by a doctor. \n\n- It's understandable you haven't started the medication yet since depression can make it hard to take initiative. However, if your psychiatrist prescribed it, they likely thought it could help manage your symptoms. It may be worth considering starting the medication, as long as you feel comfortable with the potential side effects.\n\n- If you don't feel the Depakine is the right treatment, I would recommend consulting your psychiatrist again. Explain how you've been feeling lately and any concerns you have about the medication. They may adjust the dosage, try a different medication, or suggest additional therapy. \n\n- In addition to medication, lifestyle changes like exercise, therapy, stress management, and social support can also help manage depression. Consider setting small goals each day or week to gradually make positive changes.\n\n- If your depression is getting significantly worse and you have thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out to a doctor or crisis line right away. You don't have to handle this alone. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

I am currently breastfeeding the younger one. I have a problem with my right breast which makes me doubt if it is something related to cancer. Nowadays it is getting really dry and there appear cracks on my nipple. I used Avalon nipple cream. But from yesterday my breast has shrunk and my nipples too. There are a few lumps on my nipple as well. Even though I apply cream it is not getting relieved. It is getting worse day by day.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical training to provide a diagnosis or treatment recommendations. However, I can offer some general suggestions based on the symptoms you described:\n\n- Breast changes like shrinking, nipple changes, lumps, and skin cracks/dryness can have many causes, but it is important to have them evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible. Some may be normal breastfeeding-related changes, but others could potentially indicate a more serious condition like an infection or even breast cancer.\n\n- See your OB/GYN or primary care doctor for an exam. They can help determine if your symptoms are normal or require further testing. An ultrasound, mammogram, or biopsy may be recommended. \n\n- In the meantime, keep the area clean and moisturized. Use a gentle, hypoallergenic moisturizer and avoid harsh soaps. Wear breast pads to protect sore nipples. Try warm compresses to soothe pain and swelling. Avoid anything that further irritates the area.\n\n- If you have a fever, redness, warmth, or significant pain, see a doctor urgently as it may indicate infection.\n\n- Make sure to mention your breastfeeding status, as treatments and recommendations may differ. Your doctors can help determine if it's safe to continue nursing or if you need to pause/stop while evaluating your symptoms.\n\n- Don't panic, but don't ignore it either. Many breast changes in nursing mothers are benign. But it's always best to have new symptoms evaluated promptly for peace of mind and early treatment if needed. Let your doctor guide the process.\n\nI hope this gives you some initial tips, but please do consult your own doctors as soon as possible for proper evaluation and care.

I have an abscess in my tooth for over a year now. I am getting it infected for the second time now. The previous infection was before six months. It is present at the bottom of one of my lower molars. It hurts me a lot. How long will it take to spread throughout the body?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your dental abscess:\n\n- Dental abscesses can be quite painful and need to be treated promptly by a dentist. Leaving them untreated allows the infection to spread and get worse.\n\n- Abscesses form when there is a bacterial infection deep within the tooth or gums that leads to pus building up in a pocket. They are often caused by advanced tooth decay, cracks/chips in the tooth, or severe gum disease.\n\n- If left untreated, the infection can spread from the tooth to the jawbone and other facial tissues. Very rarely, it could spread to the bloodstream and become life-threatening. However, this would usually take weeks to months if not treated.\n\n- The sooner you can see a dentist, the better. They will likely start you on antibiotics to treat the infection and will then need to drain the abscess by drilling into the tooth or performing a root canal. The infected tooth may also need to be extracted.\n\n- Getting the abscess treated now is important to prevent the infection from spreading further locally or into the bloodstream. Make an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible. The infection itself can often be cleared up in a matter of days with antibiotics and draining the abscess.\n\n- In the meantime, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers as needed for the pain. Rinsing with warm salt water may also help provide temporary relief. But do see a dentist promptly for definitive treatment. Let them know you have an active abscess so they can treat you urgently.\n\nI hope this helps provide some guidance from a general medical perspective until you can be evaluated by your dentist. Don't delay treatment, as dental infections should be dealt with promptly. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n## Output (b):\n Does the tooth abscess spread to your other teeth?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Right testicle swollen for the past five days and left testicle swollen for the past four days. On IV antibiotics, Cravit and Doribax (which replaced Rochephin). C-reactive test above 231. The doctors still cannot identify the cause. Any thoughts or recommendations? I have got ultrasounds but just shows increased blood, no abscesses.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Without examining you or having access to your medical records, I cannot provide specific medical advice. However, based on the information you provided, it sounds like you may have an infection or inflammation in your testicles (orchitis). Some possible causes could include:\n\n- Bacterial infection - Even though you are on IV antibiotics, it's possible the bacteria causing the infection is resistant to the antibiotics you've tried so far. Your doctors may need to culture the infection to identify the bacteria and make sure you're on the right antibiotics.\n\n- Viral infection - Viruses like mumps or HIV can sometimes cause testicular inflammation. Your doctors may want to test you for these viruses. \n\n- Autoimmune condition - In rare cases, testicular inflammation can be caused by an autoimmune condition where your body's immune system mistakenly attacks the testicles. Additional testing like bloodwork or a biopsy may be needed.\n\n- Unknown cause - Sometimes the exact cause of orchitis cannot be identified. But the inflammation usually improves with rest, scrotal support, anti-inflammatories and time.\n\nSince you've already had ultrasounds and are on IV antibiotics, it seems like your doctors are doing the right things to try to determine the cause and treat it. I would recommend being patient, finishing the course of antibiotics, and following up closely with your urologist. Let them know if your symptoms persist or worsen. Additional testing or a urology specialist may be needed to get to the bottom of it. I hope you feel better soon!\n\n## Output (b):\n After answering these questions, your Doctor will give you a medical consultation.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Her bite is fine but her teeth are not properly aligned and she does not have bone on her left side. Her orthodontist referred her to a maxillofacial surgeon who says she needs her upper jaw broken and rotated clockwise and slightly up to compensate for the lack of bone and her bottom jaw also has to be broken and rotated clockwise. It would all then be held by plates and screws. My biggest concern is that she is a beautiful girl and he says that her face will not change at all. Is that true with this kind of procedure?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical details to provide specific advice about your daughter's treatment plan. However, I can offer some general information about jaw surgery:\n\n- Moving the upper and/or lower jaw through osteotomies (controlled breaks) can help correct misalignments and improve the fit of the teeth. This is a common procedure in some complex orthodontic cases.\n\n- In experienced hands, these procedures aim to improve function and aesthetics while minimizing changes to the appearance of the face. However, some subtle changes are likely as the bone and soft tissue relationships change.\n\n- The surgeon should discuss potential risks and benefits of the proposed treatment plan in detail, as well as what to expect in terms of swelling, recovery time, diet changes, etc. Make sure all your questions are answered. \n\n- Get a second opinion if you have any concerns about the proposed plan. Ask to see before/after photos of similar cases the surgeon has done.\n\n- Be realistic about goals - while appearance should improve, you may not see a drastic change or achieve perfection. Follow aftercare instructions closely for best results.\n\nI would advise having an open discussion with the surgeon about your daughter's specific case, goals, and any worries you may have. Every patient is unique. Voice your concerns and have them addressed before agreeing to move forward.\n\n## Output (b):\n The doctor will know best, but these questions may help them understand your concerns.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Yesterday, doctors have checked my blood. I am visiting a hospital frequently as I have iron deficiency anemia. The thing I am scared about is, my doctor asked me why my ferritin has not increased (just the opposite, it has decreased from 5.79 to 5.77) after three months of taking iron supplements. My other iron levels are at 39 which has increased considering those references. But, that was probably because I did not use the medicine correctly, I was only taking 5 mg a day. Another thing I am worried about is, my lymphocytes kind of got increased in my blood: (52.8) - the reference is 19.4 to 44.9, and the other one is 3.57. My neutrophils kind of decreased too (36.9) and the reference was between 41.0 to 73.0.In the last week, I had a viral infection as both my parents were sick. Is it why my levels got high? My WBC is 6.77 and RBC is 4.52. My hemoglobin is also increasing actually, last time I checked, it was 11.0 and now it is 11.2. Still low, but it was good to see that it was increasing. My thrombocyte levels got higher again, unfortunately. The first time I was told that I was anemic, my thrombocyte levels were on 485, then in my second blood test (after using iron supplements correctly it decreased to 380. And yesterday, when I checked, it increased to 435 (reference is 156 to 373).I was also told that I have an infection in my urinary system and he gave me antibiotics. Honestly, I have been always getting suspected about it since my anemia has started. Should I be worried about my condition or is it normal?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, here are a few key points:\n\n- Low ferritin levels indicate iron deficiency, which is likely causing your anemia. The fact that your ferritin has not increased much despite taking iron supplements could indicate an issue with absorption. Discuss optimal dosing and types of iron supplements with your doctor.\n\n- The mildly elevated lymphocytes and decreased neutrophils may be explained by the recent viral infection. This is often seen as part of the body's immune response. As long as these levels normalize soon, it is likely not a major concern.\n\n- The recurring urinary tract infections could contribute to the anemia if they are causing inflammation or blood loss. Treating the infections and staying hydrated is important.\n\n- The thrombocytosis (high platelets) may be reactive, meaning secondary to an underlying condition like iron deficiency anemia. As your anemia is treated, the platelet count should normalize. \n\n- Overall, it seems like you are undergoing appropriate testing and treatment. Be sure to take iron supplements regularly as prescribed, prioritize nutrition, stay hydrated, and follow up as recommended. The anemia seems to be improving gradually based on the increased hemoglobin. Discuss any ongoing symptoms or concerns with your doctor. With proper treatment, the prognosis is good.\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your medical history.

These symptoms are troubling me a lot. I experience extreme nervousness, even when I do not have any emotional struggles. I have a feeling of having a fast heartbeat. At the age of 16, my blood report showed me a result of subclinical hyperthyroidism. I have done breast surgery. Due to my health concern, I always have my blood tested for thyroid.Before eight months, I also had done a Holter monitor, which showed my heart palpitations. On my final blood test, my thyroid results came normal. But still, I have the symptoms. I am trying for a baby. But I heard an issue that underlying or undiagnosed thyroid issue could become a terrible one during pregnancy. Do I need to consult an endocrinologist soon? Do these fluctuations are common in hyperthyroidism?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the symptoms you have described, it sounds like you may be experiencing anxiety and hyperthyroidism. Here are my recommendations:\n\n- Consult an endocrinologist to get your thyroid levels re-checked. Fluctuations in thyroid levels can cause symptoms like nervousness, anxiety, palpitations and weight loss. An endocrinologist can help determine if you have an underlying thyroid condition that needs treatment.\n\n- Get evaluated for anxiety by a mental health professional. Many of your symptoms - nervousness, palpitations, feeling your heart race - can also be caused by anxiety disorders. A psychiatrist or therapist can help diagnose and treat anxiety through counseling and/or medication if needed. \n\n- Ask your doctor about safe treatment options if you have hyperthyroidism and are trying to get pregnant. Untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to pregnancy complications, so it's important to get it under control. There are antithyroid medications that are generally safe in pregnancy under medical supervision. \n\n- Practice stress management and self-care. Hyperthyroidism and anxiety can worsen with increased stress. Relaxation techniques, adequate sleep, proper nutrition, exercise and support from loved ones can help manage stress.\n\n- Avoid triggers that worsen your symptoms, like excessive caffeine. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! Getting the right diagnosis and treatment is important for both your health and your pregnancy plans. Consulting an endocrinologist and a mental health professional would be a good next step.\n\n## Output (b):\n Do you have a family history of thyroid problem?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Also, I am attaching the picture for your reference. Please explain me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical training to diagnose or treat a skin condition based only on a description and photo. Some possibilities for a non-itchy red rash that spreads could include:\n\n- Viral exanthem (viral rash) such as from hand, foot and mouth disease, roseola, rubella, etc. These are often caused by common viruses and may spread over the body.\n\n- Pityriasis rosea - a common harmless rash that starts with a \"herald patch\" and spreads into a Christmas tree pattern on the back/torso.\n\n- Erythema migrans - the rash associated with Lyme disease, starts as a bull's eye lesion and slowly expands outward.\n\n- Cellulitis - a bacterial skin infection that causes a painful, red, warm rash that spreads. Requires antibiotics. \n\n- Allergic reaction - contact dermatitis from an allergen or id reaction could cause red patches and spread.\n\nWithout examining you and getting more history, I cannot diagnose the cause. I would recommend seeing your primary care doctor or a dermatologist for an evaluation. They can examine the rash, order tests if needed, and provide proper treatment.

I have has this for years and it does not bother me. On the conjunctiva, it appears also a little puffy but I have noticed on the lacrimal caruncle there seems to be a red little spot. My eyes are always dry and I suffer from allergies. Is this of any concern or is it associated with dry eyes/allergies?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, it sounds like you may have a small benign cyst on your left eye called a conjunctival cyst. These are usually not anything to worry about. The red spot on your lacrimal caruncle could be related to irritation or inflammation from dry eyes or allergies. Here are some suggestions:\n\n- Use artificial tears regularly to lubricate your eyes if they feel dry. Preservative-free tears are best if using frequently.\n\n- Take antihistamines or use nasal sprays as needed for allergy relief. This can help reduce eye irritation. \n\n- Warm compresses on the eyes can also help with dryness and irritation.\n\n- See an ophthalmologist for an exam if the cyst starts to grow, becomes irritated, or your vision is affected. They can confirm it's a benign cyst and not anything more serious.\n\n- The red spot should be monitored for any changes. If it persists despite allergy treatment, gets larger or more irritated, have it evaluated further. \n\n- Routine eye exams are recommended to monitor for any changes over time.\n\nOverall, it sounds like what you are describing could be managed with some over-the-counter treatments.

Can this disease make one blind?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Hereditary macular degeneration (HMD) is an inherited form of macular degeneration, which is a condition that affects the macula of the eye. The macula is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed central vision. \n\nIn HMD, there is progressive damage to the macula over time leading to central vision loss. It can occur in different inherited patterns such as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked inheritance. The specific genetic mutations involved can vary.\n\nThe main symptoms of HMD are:\n\n- Blurred central vision - Objects directly in front of the eye appear distorted or blurry. This starts gradually.\n\n- Central scotomas - Dark holes or blank spots in the center of vision. \n\n- Metamorphopsia - Straight lines appear wavy or bent.\n\n- Reduced color vividness and contrast sensitivity.\n\nOver time, the disease can progress to cause:\n\n- Legal blindness - Visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in the better seeing eye. This means only being able to see at 20 feet what a normal person can see at 200 feet.\n\n- Complete loss of central vision while peripheral vision remains intact. \n\nSo in summary, yes HMD can potentially lead to legal blindness and very impaired central vision over time due to progressive damage to the macula. However, the severity and rate of vision loss can vary depending on the specific genetic mutation and other factors. Regular monitoring by an ophthalmologist is important to help preserve vision. There are some emerging treatments that may help slow progression in certain cases.\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your question.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My weight is 77 kg and height is 5 feet 6 inches. What is a skipping pulse? Is it blockage in the heart or not? My test reports is as follows, Cholesterol : 247, Triglycerides : 283, Hdl : 43, Ldl : 149, VLDL : 57, Non-Hdl cholesterol : 204, Lipoprotein a : 94, HS-CRP : 8, Sugar fasting : 90, and BP mostly : 130 / 85.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Thank you for providing those details. A skipping pulse, also known as an irregular pulse, can have several potential causes. It does not necessarily indicate a blockage in the heart. Some common reasons for a skipping pulse include:\n\n- Extra beats or premature contractions of the heart (PVCs or PACs): These are usually harmless extra beats and a common cause of irregular pulse.\n\n- Atrial fibrillation: This is an abnormal heart rhythm originating in the upper chambers of the heart. It can cause an irregular, sometimes rapid pulse.\n\n- Heart block: This is when the electrical signals between the upper and lower chambers of the heart are impaired. It can make the heart beat irregularly. \n\n- Electrolyte imbalances: Abnormal levels of salts like potassium and magnesium in the blood can disrupt the heart's electrical system and cause an irregular pulse.\n\n- Medication side effects: Some medications, like digoxin, can cause an irregular heartbeat in some people.\n\n- Stress/anxiety: The fight-or-flight hormones released during stress can briefly cause an irregular pulse in some cases.\n\nBased on the information provided, your cholesterol levels are moderately elevated and triglycerides are high. These may increase your risk for heart disease long-term. I would recommend following up with your doctor, who can do a full evaluation and determine if your skipping pulse needs further testing or treatment. Lifestyle changes to improve your cholesterol and BP may also be recommended.

I am currently taking WP Thyroid. I have taken Armour and Nature-thyroid. They all make me sick to my stomach. I tried adding generic T3 and it made my symptoms worse, that is, hair loss, cold hands and feet, weight gain, fatigue, GERD, and constipation. Would a synthetic T4 and T3 be better for me such as Tirosint and Cytomel?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough medical information about your specific case to provide individual medical advice. However, here are some general considerations regarding hypothyroidism treatment options:\n\n- For some people with hypothyroidism, natural desiccated thyroid medications like Armour and Nature-throid can cause side effects like nausea. This may be due to the higher levels of T3 compared to synthetic T4-only medications. \n\n- Adding a synthetic T3 medication like Cytomel to your T4 dose can also exacerbate symptoms in some cases. This may be due to getting too much T3 relative to your individual needs.\n\n- Switching to a synthetic T4 and T3 combination medication like Tirosint and Cytomel is an option to consider. The ratio of T4 to T3 can be adjusted to find the optimal balance for your body. However, this combination requires frequent monitoring and dosage adjustments by your doctor.\n\n- Another option is trying a different brand of synthetic T4-only medication, like the name brand Synthroid or a generic levothyroxine. Sometimes people tolerate different formulations better. \n\nThe best course of action is to discuss your symptoms and options thoroughly with your endocrinologist. Dosage adjustments and close follow-up are often needed when changing thyroid hormone regimens to find the ideal balance for each patient.

My doctor prescribed Prednisone 10 mg two tablets daily for 10 days for a cough. However, since taking Prednisone, my insomnia had worsened dramatically. I stopped taking Prednisone after 10 days, but my insomnia had not improved. Is insomnia a permanent side effect of Prednisone?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your situation:\n\n- Insomnia is a known side effect of prednisone, especially at higher doses like you were taking. The good news is that it's usually temporary and resolves once the prednisone is stopped. \n\n- However, sometimes prednisone can unmask or worsen underlying insomnia, even after the medication is discontinued. This may be what's happening in your case, since you already had trouble sleeping before starting prednisone.\n\n- It's unlikely that a 10-day course of prednisone would cause permanent insomnia. It's more plausible that it triggered insomnia that's persisting due to other factors like your depression, anxiety, other medications, or sleep habits. \n\n- I would recommend being patient and giving it more time to resolve now that the prednisone is out of your system. Make sure you have good sleep habits and talk to your doctor about adjusting your other medications if needed. Consider cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia as well.\n\n- If the insomnia persists for more than a few weeks after stopping prednisone, then it would be reasonable to re-evaluate with your doctor. There may be other underlying issues sustaining poor sleep that need to be addressed. But permanent insomnia from a short steroid course is very unlikely.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! Getting good sleep is so important for health, so I hope this resolves soon.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you 18 years old or older?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

A month ago, I had a heart stroke and underwent angio for blood clotting thrombus. My CBC report at that time shows a platelet count at 24 lakhs. I received CALR Exon 9 mutation analysis report today. It reads \"CALR Exon 9 mutation is detected by PCR amplification of Exon 9 of CALR, followed by sequencing of coding and junctional region of the Exon. The sequence is compared with the reference sequence NM-004343 for the analysis of mutations.\" Hematologist prescribed me Anagrelide 0.5 mg. Do I have to worry? Can it be cured by medication?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you recently had a heart attack and underwent an angiogram procedure where they found a blood clot. Your blood work at that time showed a high platelet count of 240,000/uL (normal is 150,000-400,000/uL). \n\nThe CALR mutation analysis indicates you have a mutation in the CALR gene, which can be associated with essential thrombocythemia - a type of blood cancer that causes increased platelet production. \n\nThe anagrelide medication your hematologist prescribed helps reduce high platelet counts. Essential thrombocythemia is typically managed with medications and monitoring. Prognosis is often good with treatment, though there is a small increased risk of blood clots or progression to leukemia over time.\n\nOverall, try not to worry too much. Your doctors are aware of your condition and have started appropriate treatment. Make sure to take the anagrelide as prescribed, follow up regularly with your hematologist, and report any new symptoms. With proper management, many patients live for decades with essential thrombocythemia.

While I am sleeping, I get up just once to urinate, sometimes not at all. Do you think I have diabetes? I got my blood sugar checked, and it came out as perfectly normal (91, normal range is 80-100 for fasting). I think it is highly unlikely I am going to get diabetes in less than two years after the last checkup, but I wanted to confirm since my family has a history of this illness, and that is scaring me a bit. I am a 28-year-old male with asthma and acid reflux.I am currently on Montelukast, Advair and Omeprazole.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, here are a few thoughts:\n\n- Frequent urination and increased thirst can have several causes besides diabetes, including urinary tract infections, certain medications, excessive fluid intake, and medical conditions like diabetes insipidus. \n\n- However, the pattern you describe of increased urination and thirst mainly at night does raise some suspicion for possible new onset type 2 diabetes. This is especially true given your family history.\n\n- The normal fasting blood sugar reading you report makes diabetes less likely, but does not completely rule it out. Blood sugars can fluctuate and early diabetes may be missed on a single normal test.\n\n- I would recommend discussing these symptoms with your primary care doctor. They may want to recheck your blood sugar, either with a repeat fasting test or a glucose tolerance test. Checking a hemoglobin A1C could also help screen for diabetes.\n\n- If the test results are normal, other causes like a UTI could be explored. But your family history and pattern of symptoms justify ruling out diabetes more definitively. Catching it early allows better control.\n\nIn summary, while your recent normal blood sugar reduces the likelihood, your symptoms and risk factors are still somewhat concerning for possible new onset diabetes. Additional targeted testing and evaluation by your doctor would be prudent to determine the cause and rule out diabetes more conclusively.

It has happened a few times now. Why is this?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Without examining you or having more details, it is difficult to say for certain what may have caused your right eye to temporarily appear smaller than the left. However, a few possibilities come to mind:\n\n- A muscle spasm or twitch in the eyelid muscles around the right eye could cause the eyelid to droop or close more than normal for a brief time. This may make the eye appear smaller. Eyelid muscle spasms are generally harmless.\n\n- A transient ischemic attack (TIA) can sometimes cause temporary visual changes or drooping of one eyelid. A TIA is caused by a brief lack of blood flow to part of the brain and often lasts only a few minutes. Any sudden onset of neurological symptoms like this should be evaluated by a doctor.\n\n- Dryness of the eye surface can cause the eye to be slightly smaller. Using lubricating eye drops, staying hydrated, and blinking more frequently may help if dryness is the issue.\n\n- A migraine headache can trigger temporary visual disturbances or drooping eyelid. The visual changes tend to last longer with migraines, often 30-60 minutes.\n\nOverall, any repeated episodes of one eye appearing smaller, even briefly, should be examined by an ophthalmologist or neurologist. They can do a full evaluation to determine the underlying cause and recommend any needed treatment. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your question.

Is this the effect of water. Kindly suggest the medicine for this problem.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of your increasing white hair. However, here are a few general possibilities and suggestions:\n\n- Graying or whitening of hair is a natural part of aging and genetics. It can start in the 20s and 30s for some people. Stress and nutritional deficiencies may also contribute.\n\n- Hard water is not known to directly cause premature graying or whitening of hair. However, some minerals in hard water may build up on hair over time and make it appear duller. Clarifying shampoos can help remove those deposits.\n\n- Check for thyroid disorders or vitamin B12 deficiency with your doctor, as those can sometimes be related to premature graying. Blood tests can help determine if you have any deficiencies.\n\n- Eat a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Foods like colorful fruits and vegetables, fatty fish, nuts and seeds may help support healthy hair pigmentation. \n\n- Try reducing stress through relaxation techniques, adequate sleep, and exercise. Managing stress may help slow premature graying.\n\n- Certain natural supplements like vitamin B complex, biotin, copper, and catalase may help boost melanin production in hair, but speak to your doctor before taking any supplements.\n\n- Topical creams or hair dyes can cover up gray hair, but don't reverse the underlying causes. Discuss safe, effective options with your dermatologist if appearance is a major concern.\n\nI would recommend getting any deficiencies tested and making lifestyle changes, before considering medications or supplements.

Please see the attached picture. Involuntary frowning causes lines to run through the scar, can this be causing problems? Is it worth taping my forehead, so I cannot make frown lines? Is it worth getting a botox to stop frowning till I am healed? I am using a vitamin C and silicone scar cream to attempt better removal of hyperpigmentation. Is this a problem? I cannot tell if it is this or the creasing making it worse. I am starting to get very depressed about this scar revision. It was bad enough getting mugged and getting this wound. Now it is not healing even after a scar revision surgery. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you in person. However, some general suggestions for scar care include:\n\n- Massage the scar regularly with vitamin E oil or over-the-counter scar creams to help soften and flatten it. \n\n- Use silicone scar sheets, which may help reduce redness and thickness of scars.\n\n- Avoid sun exposure to prevent the scar from darkening. Use sunscreen daily.\n\n- Don't pick at scabs or scars as this can disrupt healing. \n\n- Stay hydrated and eat a healthy diet to promote healing.\n\n- Try to minimize facial expressions that crease the skin near the scar. Taping or botox may temporarily help with this.\n\n- Give it time. Scars often continue to improve in appearance for 6 months to a year after an injury or surgery. \n\n- See your surgeon if the scar appears infected, oozing, or excessively raised. Additional procedures like steroid injections or laser resurfacing may help revise a hypertrophic scar.\n\nThe emotional impact of scarring can be significant as well. Speaking to a counselor may help provide coping strategies and support. I hope this helps provide some guidance as you continue to heal.

But due to severe negligence and work, I could not do that. It is almost a year now, and tonight I am having a painful time. Please tell me whether there is a chance of spread of infection. Please help. My infected tooth is the right first molar of the lower jaw.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining you, but I can share some general information.\n\nLeaving a tooth infection untreated for a year does increase the risk of the infection spreading or getting worse. An infected tooth can potentially lead to problems like:\n\n- Spread of infection to surrounding teeth, gums, or jawbone. This can cause pain, swelling, and damage to those areas.\n\n- Development of an abscess at the tip of the tooth root. Abscesses require drainage and antibiotics.\n\n- Progression of decay or damage in the tooth, eventually leading to tooth loss.\n\nMy recommendation would be to see a dentist as soon as possible. They can clinically examine your tooth, take any necessary x-rays, and determine the best course of treatment. This may involve root canal therapy, antibiotics, extraction, or other options depending on the extent of infection and damage. \n\nGetting the tooth properly treated will help resolve the infection, prevent it from spreading further, and save the tooth if possible. Leaving an infected tooth untreated allows the infection to continue damaging tissue, so it's important to get it addressed. I hope this general information is helpful until you can be evaluated by a dentist. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n## Output (b):\n I'm the doctor. Based on your description, the infection may have spread to the surrounding teeth and gum. You should visit a dentist as soon as possible to prevent further complications. It's important to seek medical attention if you experience severe pain or swelling in your gums, as this could indicate an abscess or other dental infection. Regular dental checkups and proper oral hygiene can help prevent these infections and maintain your overall oral health. I recommend scheduling an appointment with a dentist as soon as possible.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Now I have a pain in that tooth which got worse this morning. My cheek and throat have a sore, and they are swollen. It became a deep cavity when my filling fell out.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions for your dental issue:\n\n- A deep cavity that develops quickly often indicates an active infection in the tooth. This can cause pain, swelling, and soreness as you've described. You'll likely need a root canal treatment or extraction to remove the infected tooth structure. See your dentist as soon as possible.\n\n- In the meantime, you can take over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help relieve the pain and swelling. Avoid putting pressure on the tooth. \n\n- Rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times a day to help keep the area clean. Be gentle when brushing near the affected tooth.\n\n- Applying a cold compress to the outside of your cheek can also help reduce swelling and discomfort. \n\n- Make sure to get the cavity restored once the infection is cleared, as a deep cavity leaves the tooth prone to further decay. A new filling or crown will protect the tooth.\n\n- Maintain excellent oral hygiene and have regular dental checkups to avoid cavities getting this advanced again. Bring up any tooth sensitivity or decay you notice early on.\n\nLet me know if the pain worsens or the swelling spreads. You may need antibiotics or the tooth extracted if the infection doesn't improve with initial treatment. Seek urgent dental care if the symptoms become severe.

A few days ago, I had a toothache on my molar teeth and have mobility when touched. I have a big hole in that tooth from my childhood. I guess the black circle is the vein of the tooth. I could not afford to get an implant tooth. I had pain in that tooth a year back and then now. Is it possible to cure with rebuilding this tooth instead of removing it? Here is the picture for your reference.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the limited information provided, here are a few thoughts:\n\n- A molar tooth with a history of decay/cavity and now mobility suggests advanced decay and infection in the tooth and surrounding bone. This usually indicates the tooth is non-restorable.\n\n- Rebuilding or restoring a tooth with significant decay is usually not recommended, as the decay will likely continue under the restoration. \n\n- Given the extent of decay described, the best option is likely extraction. An implant could be placed later on to replace the missing tooth if desired.\n\n- However, an in-person dental exam is needed to fully evaluate the tooth and determine the best treatment. X-rays would also help determine extent of decay and bone loss.\n\n- For now, you can manage pain with over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen. See a dentist soon for evaluation and treatment options. Antibiotics may be needed if there is a dental infection present.\n\n- Regular dental cleanings and good oral hygiene could help prevent extensive decay in other teeth.\n\nI hope this provides some guidance, but please see a dentist as soon as possible for a full assessment and treatment recommendations.

I am under Macfolate and Metformin tablets for the past seven months. I have regular periods for the past six months. This month, on the 11th day, I missed my period. After two days, when I checked for pregnancy, I got a negative result. Again after seven days, I got a negative result after checking for pregnancy. I am getting mucus discharge in small amounts. It does not have any foul odor. Am I pregnant? Why is it showing negative?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it does not sound like you are currently pregnant. Here are a few reasons why you may be getting negative pregnancy tests:\n\n- PCOS can cause irregular periods and missed periods, even when you are ovulating and have been having regular cycles. So a missed or delayed period does not necessarily mean pregnancy.\n\n- Pregnancy tests check for the hormone hCG. This hormone starts being produced after implantation, which happens about 6-12 days after ovulation/fertilization. So if you tested very early, there may not be enough hCG to detect yet. \n\n- The mucus discharge you describe could just be normal cervical fluid that happens throughout the menstrual cycle. It does not necessarily indicate pregnancy.\n\n- Pregnancy tests can sometimes give false negatives, especially if the hCG levels are still low and you test too early. The most accurate results come after a missed period.\n\nI would recommend waiting at least 1-2 weeks after your missed period and testing again if it has not started. If it is still negative at that point, then it is less likely you are pregnant. But sometimes patience is needed to allow hCG levels to rise high enough to get an accurate test result.

The pains are so sharp, and I can see my wisdom teeth coming out like a halfway through, it is so painful, what should I do?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions for dealing with wisdom tooth pain:\n\n- Wisdom tooth pain can occur as the teeth are erupting through the gums. This is very common at your age. The pain should subside once the teeth fully erupt. Using over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage the pain in the meantime.\n\n- Applying ice packs to the outside of your jaw near the painful area can also help reduce inflammation and pain. \n\n- Eating soft foods that don't require a lot of chewing can make eating more comfortable when you're having wisdom tooth pain. Things like mashed potatoes, yogurt, soup, eggs, etc are good options.\n\n- Gargling with warm salt water can help keep the area clean and promote healing. \n\n- You may want to see a dentist to examine the wisdom teeth and make sure they are erupting properly. If they are impacted or coming in at an odd angle, this could be causing the pain. The dentist may recommend extraction if this is the case.\n\n- If the pain becomes severe and persists for more than a few days, see a dentist right away, as you may need treatment. An infection is possible.\n\n- Over-the-counter oral numbing gels/liquids can temporarily numb the area for pain relief.\n\nLet me know if the pain worsens or does not start to improve within a week. Seeking dental treatment may be needed to address the wisdom teeth and relieve your symptoms.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer the medical questions and let us know the patient's name.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

She underwent a biopsy. In the biopsy report, it came as benign. Another test showed that she has stage 3 breast cancer (she has no symptoms) and the doctor advised us for a mastectomy. The doctor recommended us to do some tests such as blood count, breast X-ray, and ultrasound. The results came normal (there is no mass lesion present, and there is no metastasis seen). Is there any confirmatory test available to find breast cancer?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your mother's situation:\n\n- Breast biopsies are usually very accurate in determining if a breast lump is benign or malignant (cancerous). If the biopsy came back benign, it is unlikely she has breast cancer in that particular lump.\n\n- However, breast biopsies only sample a small part of the breast. It's possible your mother could have a different area of cancerous cells that wasn't sampled by the biopsy. This may explain why another test showed stage 3 breast cancer. \n\n- Additional testing like blood tests, mammograms, and ultrasounds help get a fuller picture, but they aren't definitive for diagnosing breast cancer. An MRI may be more sensitive than mammogram for detecting tumors.\n\n- The best way to confirm breast cancer diagnosis and staging is with a surgical biopsy where the entire lump and some surrounding tissue is removed and examined. This is usually done by a breast surgeon. \n\n- If multiple tests are not finding any clear evidence of breast cancer, it would be reasonable to seek a second opinion from another breast specialist before undergoing mastectomy.\n\nThe key is correlating all test results with a thorough physical exam by an experienced breast specialist. I would recommend your mother meet with a breast surgeon to discuss if further diagnostic biopsies or other testing is recommended before deciding on mastectomy. Getting a clear diagnosis is crucial.\n\n## Output (b):\n Have you discussed any of these additional symptoms with your doctor?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I believe this is contagious as one another family member of mine is facing the same issues.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the symptoms you have described, it sounds like your mother may have bacterial conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye. Here are some recommendations:\n\n- Bacterial conjunctivitis is very contagious. Encourage your mother and other affected family members to wash their hands frequently and avoid touching their eyes. Do not share towels, pillowcases or eye makeup. \n\n- Cool compresses can help soothe the eyes. Apply a clean, cool washcloth over closed eyes for 5-10 minutes as needed.\n\n- Artificial tears can help flush out the eyes and provide relief from irritation. Use preservative-free drops.\n\n- Antibiotic eye drops are usually prescribed to treat bacterial conjunctivitis. Make sure your mother finishes the entire course as directed, even if symptoms improve.\n\n- Oral antibiotics may also be prescribed if the infection is severe. Take as directed.\n\n- Avoid wearing contact lenses until the infection has cleared. \n\n- Do not put medication in the unaffected eye to prevent spreading infection.\n\nI would recommend your mother see an optometrist or ophthalmologist for an exam and proper diagnosis. Let me know if her symptoms worsen or do not improve in a few days on the antibiotic drops.

It is not that I cannot see a thing but I cannot see clearly either as compared to my right eye. I can see fully clear when it is about 5 to 10 cm from my eye (letters) but it became blurry when the distance increases. Right eye is pretty fine but left eyes are not proper as right. So what kind of medication do I need?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the symptoms you have described, it sounds like you may be experiencing some eye strain or fatigue from prolonged computer use. Here are some suggestions that may help:\n\n- Take regular breaks when using the computer. Follow the 20-20-20 rule - every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break and look at something 20 feet away. This allows your eyes to relax and refocus.\n\n- Ensure you have proper lighting and reduce glare on the screen. Position the screen below eye level and away from bright lights or windows to avoid glare.\n\n- Check your screen resolution, text size, and work distance. Make sure text on the screen is large and clear enough for comfortable reading at your normal working distance. Adjust settings as needed.\n\n- Have your eyes examined. See an optometrist or ophthalmologist to check if you need glasses for computer use or reading. You may benefit from a prescription for computer glasses.\n\n- Use artificial tear eye drops to lubricate eyes if they feel dry or irritated from prolonged computer use.\n\n- Be sure to get enough sleep. Fatigue can worsen eye strain.\n\n- Consider computer eyewear designed to block blue light and reduce digital eye strain.\n\nImplementing proper eye care habits like taking breaks, adjusting your workstation setup, hydrating eyes, and getting your vision checked can help prevent or alleviate computer-related eye discomfort.

But it could also be something more concerning like a wart, precancerous lesion, or other condition.\n\n- With your medical history, it's best to have any new skin changes evaluated promptly. Make an appointment with your doctor soon to get the rash examined and tested.\n\n- In the meantime, watch for any changes in the rash like growth, color changes, pain, itching, oozing, etc. Take a photo of it now for comparison later.\n\n- Protect the area from trauma and keep it clean and dry. Avoid picking or scratching the rash.\n\n- If you have any worrisome symptoms like fever, swelling, red streaks from the rash, etc., seek medical evaluation right away.\n\nThe key is to not panic, but don't wait to get it evaluated.

When after eating or having something hot or cold, I feel sensitive and after that, I get pain for some time but the pain goes away automatically. I have gone to one of the dentists and she suggested me to get a root canal treatment done but I feel that the pulp or tissue of that tooth is not yet damaged and can be recovered without doing a root canal. I am attaching a picture of my tooth. Kindly suggest me whether the root canal is needed for this or I can save my tooth using some other methods?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult for me to make a definitive treatment recommendation without examining you in person. However, here are a few general thoughts:\n\n- Sensitive/painful response to hot and cold foods/drinks suggests the pulp tissue inside the tooth may be inflamed or damaged. This could potentially warrant a root canal treatment to remove the inflamed/infected pulp and prevent further infection.\n\n- However, if the pain is mild and goes away quickly on its own, the pulp may not be irreversibly damaged yet. In that case, more conservative treatments could be attempted first.\n\n- Conservative options may include desensitizing toothpaste, fluoride treatments, bonding/sealants over any cracks/grooves in the tooth, or a filling if there is a cavity causing sensitivity. \n\n- The goal would be to calm the inflammation and prevent further damage to allow the pulp to heal. If symptoms persist despite these measures, then root canal may be necessary.\n\nWithout an exam, I can't say for certain which option is best. I'd recommend following up with your dentist, communicating your concerns, and asking if more conservative treatments are reasonable to try first before considering root canal. They should be able to provide a clearer recommendation based on an in-person assessment.

At that time, my vision in the right eye was hand movements only and I was diagnosed with a macular injury. Three months later, my vision slowly improved to 6/36. However, my right eye started to deviate (exotropia) and I started experiencing diplopia. My main problem is diplopia. I have used prisms, but of no use. When I try to focus on an image, I have severe diplopia. The diplopia disappears when I try to correct the squint. At present, I am doing higher studies and the diplopia is really bothering me. Will doing a squint surgery be of any use? Is there anything that I can try?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, here are my thoughts as a doctor:\n\nGiven your history of traumatic injury to the right eye resulting in reduced vision and macular damage, it seems you have developed a consecutive exotropia (outward turning of the eye) over time. This misalignment of the eyes is likely causing your diplopia (double vision). \n\nSince prism glasses have not helped correct the double vision, surgery to realign your eyes (strabismus surgery) may be an option to consider. The goal would be to surgically adjust the eye muscles to allow the eyes to work together again and reduce the double vision. This may involve recessing and/or resecting some of the extraocular muscles. \n\nThe surgery has a good chance of significantly improving your double vision, though there is no guarantee it would resolve it completely given the underlying vision loss in that eye. Proper alignment is important for allowing your eyes to work together. However, the reduced vision in the right eye could still lead to some visual confusion.\n\nIn the meantime, using an eye patch over the right eye some of the time may help manage the diplopia when needed. Vision therapy/orthoptic exercises may also help improve eye coordination abilities. I would recommend consulting with both an ophthalmologist who specializes in strabismus surgery and an optometrist trained in low vision rehabilitation to fully evaluate your case and discuss pros/cons of surgery.

I also have an upper molar that is broken decayed and has been like this for years. The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw. The dentist had said the next thing she could give me was Clindamycin, but I have a fear of the side effects of that medicine. I already have heart problems and mild stomach issues. I have read that Clindamycin can cause severe gastrointestinal problems and arrhythmias. She also suggested Zithromax, but I have had heart palpitations while on that medication as well. I am having the teeth removed by an oral surgeon in two weeks, but am afraid of dying from infection before then. What are my options? What is the best course of action? Are there other antibiotics for this? Am I dying from the infection already? Any of your advice or help is appreciated. My other possibly relevant health history is as follows: I have high blood pressure, tachycardia, high cholesterol and mild PVC\\s. I had a MRSA infection in my arm 10 years ago. I have many strep throat infections every year and frequent sinus issues. Also, I would like to mention that when I took smoothed Cephalexin capsule with a sip of water, I got a random salty taste in my mouth.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, here are my recommendations as a doctor:\n\n- The infection in your wisdom tooth needs to be treated more aggressively before it spreads. Cephalexin alone may not be enough. I would recommend getting a stronger antibiotic like amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) or clindamycin. The risks of letting the infection worsen likely outweigh the risks of the antibiotics. \n\n- For the decayed molar, the best option is to have it extracted by an oral surgeon as soon as possible. Leaving a severely decayed tooth can allow bacteria to enter the body and also lead to more pain/infection. Extraction is the definitive treatment.\n\n- Good oral hygiene and salt water rinses can help provide some temporary relief while waiting for antibiotics/extraction. But you need the source of infection removed ultimately.  \n\n- Monitor for fever, swelling of the face/neck, difficulty swallowing/breathing. If any of those occur, go to the ER immediately, as it could mean the infection is spreading deeper. But this is unlikely based on your current symptoms.\n\n- While scary, dying from a tooth infection is very rare, especially when being treated. The antibiotics should prevent it from worsening before the extraction.  \n\n- If you have concerns about the antibiotics, discuss with your dentist. But augmentin or clindamycin are usually well-tolerated. Short term use is unlikely to cause severe side effects. And the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n- Stay in close contact with your dentist and oral surgeon. Do not delay the extraction once scheduled. Getting the infected teeth out will be the ultimate solution.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! Overall, try not to worry excessively. With proper treatment, this should resolve without serious complications.\n\n## Output (b):\n Did the dentist say anything about the pain level in your jaw?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I had visited a dentist for a check-up. He did X-ray of my teeth and told me that food stuck between molar teeth and wisdom teeth is causing pain. So he advised me to remove wisdom teeth and filling process. But I am scared that upper teeth have a connection with brain and eyes. So, the process of teeth removal can harm my eyes and brain. Please advise me what I can do. If I do not remove my teeth, then what will be its side effect?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions regarding your wisdom teeth pain:\n\n- Wisdom teeth removal is a very common and generally safe procedure when done properly by an oral surgeon. There is no direct anatomical connection between the upper wisdom teeth and the brain or eyes that would be impacted by removal. \n\n- However, it's understandable to have concerns about any surgical procedure. Discuss your worries thoroughly with your dentist/surgeon so they can explain the process and potential risks to help put your mind at ease.\n\n- Leaving impacted wisdom teeth in place long-term can increase your risk of dental problems like tooth decay, gum disease, cysts, or dental crowding/misalignment. Food trapped around the wisdom teeth creates an environment for bacteria to thrive.\n\n- If you decide not to remove them, be diligent about oral hygiene around the wisdom teeth. Use a soft brush or dental picks to keep the area clean. See your dentist regularly to monitor for any problems developing.\n\n- Consider getting a second opinion from another dentist/surgeon to see if they agree wisdom tooth removal is recommended. Not all impacted wisdom teeth require removal if they are not causing issues.\n\n- There are alternatives like wisdom tooth coronectomy that may be an option in some cases. This removes only the crown portion and leaves the roots intact.\n\nThe best thing is to discuss all your concerns and options with your dentist. Don't rush into anything until you feel fully informed and comfortable with the treatment plan. With proper care, wisdom teeth can often be removed safely and prevent more serious dental problems down the road.

Anything eaten gets vomited out, intense weakness and fatigue. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the information provided, it sounds like you may have typhoid fever. Some key points:\n\n- A positive Widal test indicates the presence of antibodies against the bacteria that causes typhoid fever, suggesting current or recent infection.\n\n- High eosinophil count in liver function tests can happen with typhoid fever as the body reacts to the infection.\n\n- Inability to keep food down, extreme fatigue, and weakness are common symptoms of typhoid fever.\n\nWithout being able to examine you in person, I cannot make a definitive diagnosis. However, your symptoms are very concerning for typhoid fever. I would recommend seeing a doctor as soon as possible for further evaluation, which may include blood or stool cultures to confirm the diagnosis. Typhoid fever requires prompt treatment with antibiotics to fight the infection. Rest, fluids, and fever control are also important. Let me know if the symptoms persist or get worse, as complications like intestinal bleeding can occur.

There are no signs of it from the last one year. However, she has these bulging eyes all the time, but she can perfectly see everything with her spectacles. I do not really know what happened to her the other day. She was watching her favorite TV show and all of sudden, her right eye popped out of her eye socket and she started shouting. It was such a scary and frightening situation where I and my dad did not know what to do and out of nowhere, my dad suddenly pushed her eye with a little pressure and the eye was back in its position as usual. My mom experienced severe pain after this incident when she was rushed to an Ophthalmologist. The doctor had no clue about the reason for her eye pop out. However, I advised her to go through a few medical tests and the results are yet to come. Meantime, I just want to understand why this happened to her and will this happen regularly and what is the treatment needed to prevent this from happening again. I just do not want to think of any situation where she is alone in the home and the same happens to her. I just want her to be completely cured from this one. Please help me with my query.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the description provided, it sounds like your mother may have experienced an eye prolapse or ectropion, where the eyeball slips forward out of the eye socket. This can sometimes happen in people with thyroid eye disease or Graves' disease. Some potential causes and recommendations:\n\n- The bulging eyes (proptosis) from thyroid disease can cause weakness of the eye muscles and tissues around the eye, increasing risk of prolapse. Treating the underlying thyroid condition is important.\n\n- It's good she saw an ophthalmologist. They may recommend additional tests to evaluate eye and eyelid anatomy and function. This can help determine if any reconstructive surgery is needed to tighten eyelid tissues.\n\n- Using lubricating eye drops, taping the eyelids closed when sleeping, and wearing sunglasses can help protect the eyes and potentially reduce risk of another prolapse episode.\n\n- Promptly seeing the ophthalmologist again if there is a repeat prolapse is important, to reduce risk of vision problems or eye injury.\n\n- Consulting an endocrinologist may also be recommended, to ensure her thyroid levels and any related eye conditions are well-controlled with medication.\n\nI hope this helps provide some guidance while you await the test results. Let me know if you have any other questions! The key is getting the right specialists involved to protect her vision and reduce recurrences.\n\n## Output (b):\n What would you like to ask the doctor?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Could you please see if the report is fine? Will I require a vaccination dose for the same (I had the vaccination in childhood)? Is it harmful to have the vaccination more than once?I had a rheumatic heart surgery four years ago (aortic valve replacement). Currently, I am on Betaloc 12.5 mg, Ecosprin 75 mg, and Warfarin 5 mg.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the limited information provided, I cannot interpret your blood test results or provide specific medical advice. However, I can provide some general information about MMR immunity and vaccinations:\n\n- MMR blood tests check for antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella. Presence of antibodies usually indicates prior infection or vaccination. \n\n- If antibody levels are low or absent, it may indicate susceptibility to these viruses and your doctor may recommend an MMR vaccine booster.\n\n- MMR vaccines are generally safe and effective. Getting an extra dose if you've already had one is not harmful, though usually not necessary if prior immunity is confirmed.\n\n- People with compromised immune systems, including some heart conditions, may have reduced response to vaccines. Your doctor should evaluate your specific medical history when deciding about revaccination. \n\n- The MMR vaccine is not live, so it is usually safe for people on immunosuppressants like warfarin. But your doctor should confirm this given your cardiac history.\n\nI would recommend discussing your test results and immunization history with your cardiologist or primary care provider. They can best advise if an MMR booster is recommended in your case based on a full review of your health status and medications.

He snores every night and tosses and turns and has trouble breathing through his nose. His doctor says he has enlarged tonsils and adenoids. I think he has obstructed sleep apnea because I hear him gasping for air sometimes.We did a sleep study and the night of the sleep study he slept well. But every night at home he has a lot of trouble sleeping. He wakes up a lot, talks in his sleep has nightmares and I think he has sleep apnea because I hear him gasping for air sometimes.The doctor said we could try Flonaise to help him. But we read that Flonaise can stunt a child's growth. The doctor said he could grow into his tonsils. And I also heard that 2 years old is very young for tonsil surgery.My questions are how worried should I be about his troubled seeping? I am not getting any sleep lately because I listen to him all night. Is it dangerous to let him go on trying to sleep and have so much trouble breathing each night with possible sleep apnea? Please help. I am very concerned.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I understand your concern as a parent about your son's sleep issues and potential sleep apnea. However, without personally evaluating your son and reviewing his full medical history and sleep study results, I cannot provide specific medical advice. Here are some general suggestions that may help provide guidance:\n\n- Sleep apnea in young children can be serious if untreated. Discuss your concerns about the sleep study results not showing apnea with your son's doctor. Additional testing may be needed to capture his sleep issues at home.\n\n- There are various treatment options besides surgery that can be explored first, like nasal sprays/steroids, antihistamines, allergy testing, etc. Surgery has risks and is usually a last resort if other treatments fail.\n\n- Enlarged tonsils/adenoids are a common cause of sleep disordered breathing in children. However, surgery at age 2 may not always be recommended as first line. There are pros and cons to operating at a very young age that the ENT can discuss. \n\n- Lack of sleep for both your son and you is problematic. See if adjustments to his sleep environment could optimize his sleep (white noise machine, cool room temp, consistent bedtime routine etc). Temporary medications may help while determining the best treatment plan.\n\n- Get support and tips from your son's pediatrician and ENT specialist. Advocate for more testing if you still have concerns. With their partnership, you can find the right solutions for your son's health and development.\n\nI hope these general suggestions provide some guidance during this challenging time. Each child's case is unique, so rely on the doctors who know your son's details to recommend the safest and most effective treatments.

I got married five months back. Initially two months back, I was able to do intercourse well but now before the start of the intercourse, I am getting the ejaculation. We are planning for a child now but I am much worried. My height is 187 cm and weight is 102 kg.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions that may help with premature ejaculation:\n\n- Try using thicker condoms to reduce sensitivity. You can also try condoms with a numbing agent.\n\n- Masturbate an hour or two before intercourse to help delay ejaculation during sex. \n\n- Try using a numbing spray or cream on the penis before intercourse. These can temporarily decrease sensitivity.\n\n- Practice Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. This can give you more control over ejaculation.\n\n- Try the 'stop-start' technique during intercourse. If you feel yourself getting close, pull out and wait 30-60 seconds before continuing. \n\n- Avoid anxious thoughts during sex. Focus on your partner and the pleasure of the moment to distract your mind. \n\n- Consider seeing your doctor about prescription medications that can help delay ejaculation, like SSRIs or topical anesthetics.\n\n- Seek counseling or sex therapy if relationship issues or anxiety are factors. Addressing these may improve ejaculatory control.\n\nPremature ejaculation is common and treatable. Combining techniques and having patience can help overcome this over time.

She had a heavy cold and cough last week due to which she got a temperature of 99.8. So I gave her Calpol 250 next day morning similar range so I again continued the medicine and visited the doctor. He said continue fever doses irrespective of whether there is or not for three days post which the same day and next day she had no fever but again suddenly she got 99.5 and till night it went to 102.8 and did not reduce at all till we visited the doctor next day. He asked us to take blood urine reports are prescribed antibiotic Augmentin and continued to Calpol and SOS Meftal syrup as he sighted bacterial infection. Now she is taking antibiotic four doses plus Paracetomol but fever keeps coming back. So, by yesterday night gave her Meftal post which her fever came down. Should I continue Meftal syrup irrespective of fever level along with Calpol and antibiotic as to control the fever levels? I am worried why the fever keeps coming back the same level even though now four doses of antibiotic are completed.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions based on the information provided:\n\n- It's good you took your daughter to see the doctor. Fever persisting for more than 3 days often indicates an infection needing antibiotics.\n\n- Augmentin is a reasonable antibiotic choice for a bacterial infection in a child. It's important she finishes the full course as prescribed, even if she seems better, to fully treat the infection. \n\n- Alternating paracetamol (Calpol) and ibuprofen (Meftal) is a good strategy to help control fever. You can give a dose of one, then the other, every 3-4 hours as needed. Don't exceed maximum daily doses.\n\n- Fevers may persist for 2-3 days into antibiotic treatment before resolving as the infection clears. As long as she is drinking fluids, not appearing ill, and the fever is controlled with medications, it's okay to continue the current plan.\n\n- If the fever persists more than 2-3 days on the antibiotic, or goes over 104F, or she has worsening symptoms, contact the doctor again for re-evaluation. \n\n- Make sure she gets lots of fluids and rest. Monitor for dehydration. Fever can increase fluid loss.\n\nOverall it sounds like appropriate care so far. Give the medications and antibiotic time to work. Contact the doctor if fever persists or she worsens despite treatment.

And it ended a week later. Today (five days after it ended), I had some brown discharge (this was about 11 hours ago). And this is gonna sound really weird but when I was in the shower (11 hours later) I stuck my finger up there and when I pulled my finger out there was a lot of blood and discharge and it smells terrible. Is this normal to have this much discharge so close to my past period?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Based on the details provided, some possible explanations for the bleeding and foul-smelling discharge 5 days after your period could include:\n\n- Residual bleeding/discharge at the very end of your menstrual cycle is common. The brown discharge you noticed earlier suggests old blood clearing out.\n\n- However, the heavy, smelly bleeding you describe after inserting your finger could signify an infection or irritation inside the vagina. Certain infections like bacterial vaginosis or even a small abrasion from friction can cause bleeding and foul odors.\n\n- There is also a small chance it could be related to a gynecological condition like fibroids or polyps, which can sometimes cause intermittent bleeding between periods.\n\nSince this is an abnormal amount of bleeding for you, I would recommend getting examined by your gynecologist. They can check for signs of infection and examine your cervix and uterus more thoroughly to rule out any underlying issues.\n\nIn the meantime, avoid inserting fingers or objects into the vagina, use pads instead of tampons, and monitor for fever, chills, abdominal pain or other symptoms.

The bleeding is not normal, and her period was not due. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I understand your concern, but cannot provide medical advice without examining the patient. However, I can share some general information.\n\nThe emergency contraceptive pill Unwanted 72 works mainly by delaying or preventing ovulation. It is normal for menstrual cycles to be irregular after taking emergency contraception. The timing of the next period may be earlier or later than expected. Abnormal bleeding can also occur.\n\nIf the abnormal bleeding continues or is heavy, it would be best for your wife to see a gynecologist for an evaluation. They can check for any issues like infection, hormonal imbalance, or problems with the uterine lining. An ultrasound or other tests may be recommended if needed.\n\nSome care recommendations are to rest, avoid strenuous activity, use a heating pad for cramps, and maintain hydration. Sanitary pads can help manage heavy bleeding. Over-the-counter pain relievers may help with cramps. However, your wife should see a doctor if the bleeding remains heavy or if she develops any severe symptoms.\n\nI hope this general information is helpful, but please consult your wife's gynecologist for proper medical evaluation and care recommendations specific to her situation.

I am worried about any possible infection that could happen. I did a p24 antigen test. The results are p24 antigen on fourth day-0.125, sixth day-0.254, ninth day-0.271, twelfth day-0.274, fifteenth day-0.396, nineteenth day-0.540.I am upset about the increase in count. Please advise. I have done PCR RNA after 15 days for HIV 1, and it is not of detected status and HIV 2 ELISA on the nineteenth day which was also nonreactive. Kindly advise.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining the patient, but I can offer some general information.\n\nThe p24 antigen test detects a protein associated with HIV. Levels of this antigen tend to increase in the first few weeks after infection as the virus replicates. However, p24 levels can fluctuate, so trends are more meaningful than individual values. \n\nThe PCR RNA and HIV 2 ELISA tests you mentioned are more definitive tests for HIV infection. Since both of these were negative at 15 and 19 days after potential exposure, this makes HIV infection very unlikely.\n\nI would recommend discussing your concerns and test results with your doctor. Repeat testing may help provide reassurance, as HIV antibodies take time to develop. Your doctor can also discuss options for STI testing and counseling regarding safe sex practices. Try not to panic - the negative PCR and ELISA results are encouraging.

My height is 5.7 and wife is 5.1. I am extremely worried about my children height as we are short. My daughter is now 3 years 10 months old and have 14.5 kg weight and 38 inches tall. She had seizure thrice and taking some sodium liquid medicine for the past three years. My son is 1 year old and 10.2 kg weights and 28 inches tall. I want to know what would be the appropriate height of my children as per current status. Is there anything I can do to increase their height? I want my daughter to be 5.6 tall and son to be 6 ft tall. Will giving protein powder make any difference? Kindly do the needful.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few thoughts on your children's growth and height:\n\n- A child's adult height is largely determined by genetics. As parents, your heights give a good indication of the range your children's heights may end up. \n\n- Your daughter's height and weight seem to be tracking normally for a 3.5 year old girl. It's too early to predict her final adult height accurately, but based on parental heights, 5'6\" is likely achievable. \n\n- Your son's height and weight also seem on track for a 1 year old boy. Predicting his final adult height is very difficult at this age. 6ft may be ambitious based on parental heights. \n\n- Nutrition, especially protein, is important for growth. But excessive protein supplementation won't make a significant difference in final height. A balanced, nutritious diet is best.\n\n- For your daughter, ensuring her seizure disorder is well-controlled is most important right now for healthy development. Work closely with her neurologist. \n\n- Aside from nutrition, make sure your kids get adequate sleep and physical activity. Support their overall health and development. Their genetics will play the biggest role in their final heights. Focus on helping them reach their full potential whatever their heights.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer the questions below to help us diagnose your condition.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I recently went to my doctor because I lost some of my hearing, and I have been having pains in my right ear. My doctor told me that the ear drum healed but there is a lot of scarring on it. Why is my eardrum hurting if it is improved?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few possible reasons why your eardrum may be hurting even though it has healed from the previous rupture:\n\n- Scarring on the eardrum can sometimes cause pain. The scar tissue is less flexible than normal eardrum tissue, so any movement or pressure changes in the ear can cause pain from the scar tissue pulling on the remaining healthy parts of the eardrum.\n\n- Fluid buildup behind the eardrum (known as otitis media) can put pressure on the scarred eardrum and cause pain. This is common after a ruptured eardrum as the damaged eardrum may not drain fluid as well.\n\n- Eustachian tube dysfunction. The tubes that connect the middle ear to the back of the throat can become blocked, also leading to fluid buildup and pain. The scarred eardrum may interfere with proper functioning of the Eustachian tube.\n\n- Re-rupture is possible. If your eardrum healed improperly or is very thin and stiff from scarring, it could be more prone to re-rupturing, causing pain.\n\n- Outer ear infections can cause generalized ear pain even if the eardrum itself looks healed.\n\n- Nerve damage from the original rupture may be causing neuropathic pain signals even without active inflammation/infection.\n\nThe first step would be examining the ear and determining if any fluid buildup or new rupture is present. Treatment depends on the underlying cause - antibiotics for infections, decongestants or tubes to drain fluid, pain medication, etc. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your question.

One year ago, I was suffering from a hard stool that was difficult to pass. I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days. During this time, I was always sleepy. I took leave from work and was always tired and fatigued. Earlier this month, I went to another GI specialist who did a sigmoidoscopy and said that it is SRUS. He said that I should not finger evacuate the stools and gave me liquid paraffin and LoX cream. Now, my current situation is that it has been three days and I am very constipated and fatigued. The pain has subsided a little. However, I am not passing stools as I used to before. After I drink water or eat something, I get a vomiting sensation. I get anxiety and panic attacks as I am scared about my condition and do not know which doctor I should consult and what I should do. Is this condition serious and life-long? Will I ever be cured? Please advise on the correct medications (allopathy or ayurveda), lifestyle changes and other things to take care.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are some suggestions based on the information provided:\n\n- Anal fissures, hemorrhoids, and SRUS (solitary rectal ulcer syndrome) can be painful conditions, but are typically manageable with proper treatment. Constipation often contributes to these issues. \n\n- It's best to work with a gastroenterologist for proper diagnosis and treatment planning. Stick with one doctor rather than seeking multiple opinions, as this can lead to conflicting advice.\n\n- To help constipation, increase fiber intake gradually, drink plenty of fluids, exercise regularly, and do not ignore urges to have a bowel movement. Stool softeners like liquid paraffin can help ease passage. \n\n- Topical creams like sucralfate (Sucralcoat) and lidocaine (LoX) can provide pain relief for anal fissures and hemorrhoids. Sitz baths may also help.\n\n- For anxiety, relaxation techniques, counseling, or medications may help in the short term. Focus on proper treatment of the underlying conditions for long term relief.\n\n- This may take some time to fully resolve but is very manageable. Be patient, follow your doctor's advice, and make lifestyle changes to prevent constipation. With proper care, you should be able to achieve relief.\n\nThe key is regular follow-up with your gastroenterologist, sticking to the treatment plan, and managing constipation through diet and lifestyle. Don't lose hope - with a concerted effort, most patients find their symptoms can be well-controlled. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for the details.

However, based on the description provided, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. Some suggestions:\n\n- Avoid any foods, drinks, medications that aggravate the stomach symptoms. Stick to a bland diet of foods that are gentle on the stomach.\n\n- Try over-the-counter antacids or acid reducers like famotidine (Pepcid) to see if it helps relieve the stomach pain/discomfort. \n\n- If symptoms persist or worsen, it's best to see your primary care doctor. They can do further evaluation to determine the cause, such as testing for H. pylori infection or referring for an upper endoscopy. Treatment may involve medications to reduce stomach acid, antibiotics if there is an H. pylori infection, etc.\n\n- Make sure to follow up closely with your doctor if the symptoms are not improving with initial treatment. Severe or persistent gastritis/ulcers may need more aggressive treatment.\n\nThe key is proper evaluation and treatment guided by your doctor.

I am currently on Suboxone 12 mg, 6 in AM and 6 in PM. When I asked what they will be using to sedate, they said Fentanyl and Versed. I asked for Profol but got no answer. I spoke to a male nurse, not an anesthesiologist. If the Fenytal overrides the sub will I be in withdraw? Also, are there safety issues combining these medicines? Should I cancel this procedure?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining the patient, but can share some general information.\n\nFentanyl is commonly used for sedation during cardiac catheterization procedures and is generally safe when administered by an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist in a monitored setting. It has a short duration of action. \n\nThere is potential for fentanyl to override buprenorphine (Suboxone) and precipitate opioid withdrawal, but this risk is lower with short-acting fentanyl compared to other opioids. The providers administering the sedation should be aware of the patient's Suboxone use and monitor closely for signs of withdrawal. \n\nVersed (midazolam) is also commonly used for sedation and amnesia during procedures. It can be safely combined with fentanyl when properly dosed.\n\nThe decision to proceed with or cancel the procedure should be made in consultation with the proceduralist and anesthesiology team who will be caring for the patient during the catheterization. They can best assess the risks and benefits of proceeding versus cancelling based on the patient's medical history and procedure details. Open communication about the patient's concerns and medication history is important.\n\n## Output (b):\n All right, Doctor.

My nose has been blocked for about a week now and every time I blow my nose, my head hurts a lot. It also hurts when I shake my head.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Here are a few suggestions based on the symptoms you described:\n\n- It sounds like you may have sinusitis, which is an inflammation of the sinuses often caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The symptoms of headache, facial pain, nasal congestion, and worsened pain when moving the head are common with sinusitis. \n\n- To help relieve symptoms, you can try using a humidifier, applying warm compresses over the sinuses, drinking plenty of fluids, and using over-the-counter nasal saline sprays or decongestants. Avoid flying if possible.\n\n- If symptoms persist for more than 7-10 days without improvement, you should see your doctor. They may prescribe antibiotics if a bacterial infection is the cause. \n\n- Pain medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve headache and facial pain. Avoid aspirin if you have asthma.\n\n- Applying a warm compress over the eyes may also help soothe eye pain. Use a clean washcloth soaked in warm water. \n\n- Make sure to get enough rest. Stay hydrated and avoid irritants like cigarette smoke which can worsen symptoms.\n\n- See your doctor promptly if you develop a high fever, severe headache, or vision changes, as these can indicate a complication.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

In the allopathic approach, the hormone needs to be taken for the rest of one\\s life and I am a bit scared of it. It is possible I may also be diabetic and will need to treat this as well. Can these conditions be successfully dealt with through ayurvedic treatments alone?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I do not have enough information about your specific medical history and test results to provide personal medical advice. However, in general:\n\n- Hypothyroidism is usually a chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment. The standard treatment is daily thyroid hormone replacement medication like levothyroxine. This replaces the thyroid hormone that your body is not making enough of on its own. \n\n- There is limited evidence that Ayurvedic treatments can help manage hypothyroid symptoms, but they are usually not enough to fully replace thyroid medication. Work closely with an endocrinologist to determine if any dose adjustments to your thyroid medication may be possible based on your symptoms and lab work.\n\n- For diabetes, Ayurveda may help improve diet, exercise, and stress management which can aid blood sugar control. However, most patients with diabetes require standard medical treatment like lifestyle changes, metformin, and potentially insulin. Work with your doctor to create a treatment plan that incorporates the best of conventional and Ayurvedic medicine.\n\n- Never stop or change dosages of prescribed thyroid medication or diabetes medications without clear guidance from your managing doctor, as this can be dangerous. \n\n- Be wary of claims that Ayurveda or other alternative treatments can \"cure\" hypothyroidism or diabetes completely. While they may help manage symptoms, these are chronic conditions that require ongoing monitoring and treatment in most cases.\n\nThe best approach is to work with qualified doctors to determine the right balance of modern and Ayurvedic medicine tailored to your individual health needs. Your doctors can provide specific medical advice based on your test results, health history and goals. I hope this gives you a helpful overview on approaching your treatment options.

If both outputs are equal quality, respond with 'Tie'.  Your answer should ONLY contain: \"Output (a)\", \"Output (b)\" or \"Tie\". Here's an example:\n\n# Example:\n## Instruction:\nGive a description of the following job: \"ophthalmologist\"\n\n## Output (a):\nAn ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases and conditions.\n\n## Output (b):\nAn ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who pokes and prods at your eyes while asking you to read letters from a chart.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\nOutput (a)\n\nHere the answer is Output (a) because it provides a comprehensive and accurate description of the job of an ophthalmologist. In contrast, output (b) is more of a joke.\n\n# Task:\nNow is the real task, do not explain your answer, just say Output (a), Output (b) or Tie.\n\n## Instruction:\nHuman: If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\nHello doctor,I have an important query about the contraceptive pill. On the 2nd, my girlfriend started her period. It is now the 16th. So, I believe she is in her ovulation phase. Since her period stopped, she has begun, for the very first time, taking the combined contraceptive pill consistently at 8 AM every morning. She took the pill yesterday morning. Last night, on the 15th of March, we had unprotected sex (we thought one night without condoms would be fine). However, this morning she was in a rush and forgot to take her pill for today. It is 2:16 PM now and I have a few urgent questions:Should she take the morning after pill?How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today?Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk?Should we be worried?Thank you.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I cannot provide medical advice without examining the patient. However, I can offer some general information.\n\nThe contraceptive pill works primarily by preventing ovulation. It is less effective if pills are missed around the time of ovulation. Taking the morning after pill as soon as possible after unprotected sex can help prevent pregnancy, but it is not 100% effective. Its effectiveness depends on where the woman is in her menstrual cycle. \n\nI would advise speaking to a pharmacist or doctor about the specific risks and recommendations in this situation. They can look at the details of the specific contraceptive pill and timing of doses missed. Getting medical advice is important to understand the options available and make an informed decision on next steps.\n\nThe most important things are taking any missed contraceptive pills as soon as possible, considering emergency contraception like the morning after pill, and being aware of the risks of unprotected sex during ovulation. Speaking to a medical professional can help determine the best course of action and provide peace of mind. Let me know if you have any other general questions!\n\n## Output (b):\n Was your girlfriend using the pill before?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}
