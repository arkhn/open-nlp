It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the infection is still present in your body, and it is recommended that you get examined by a doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms. Depending on the results of the examination, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or other medications to treat the infection. In the meantime, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help relieve your symptoms.

Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Have you experienced any of the following symptoms associated with cocaine use? Please select all that apply.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nUnfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on a variety of factors such as the amount of cocaine used, the frequency of use, and the individual's metabolism. Generally, cocaine can stay in the body for up to 72 hours, but it can remain in the system for up to a week or more. It is also important to note that cocaine can remain in sperm for up to 5 days after use. Therefore, it is best to wait at least a week before trying to conceive to ensure that the cocaine is out of your system.

I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Has there been any changes to the patient's condition?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is normal to have some residual brown discharge after your period. This is usually caused by old blood that has been in the uterus for a while and is now being expelled. It is not usually a cause for concern. However, if the discharge is accompanied by any other symptoms such as pain, itching, or a foul odor, then you should see your doctor for further evaluation. As for the bleeding during sex, this could be caused by a number of things such as an infection or a hormonal imbalance.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Thank you for your information. I will be sure to pass this on to the doctor. Is there anything else you would like to inform me of?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the hard lump is due to swelling from the wisdom tooth extraction. It is also possible that it is a hematoma, which is a collection of blood that has pooled in the area. It is important to follow up with your dentist to make sure that the lump is not something more serious. If it is due to swelling, it should go away with time.

Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did you do any research into your symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to give you a definitive answer without more information.

I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n It might be best to start with a general question.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nBacterial vaginosis is a common condition that can cause a fishy odor. It is usually treated with antibiotics, such as Metronidazole. However, if the infection is not treated, it can lead to more serious complications, such as infertility. The risk of infertility is low, but it is important to seek medical attention if you are concerned about your symptoms. Your doctor can help you determine the best course of treatment for your condition. Additionally, there are some lifestyle changes that can help reduce the risk of recurrent bacterial vaginosis, such as avoiding douching, wearing loose-fitting clothing, and avoiding scented soaps and products.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of related to this issue?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to diagnose your condition without a physical examination. However, it is possible that you are experiencing a form of facial nerve dysfunction, such as trigeminal neuralgia or Bell's palsy. It is also possible that you are experiencing a form of anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. I would recommend that you see a neurologist for a physical examination and further testing to determine the cause of your symptoms. Additionally, it may be beneficial to speak with a mental health professional to assess for any underlying anxiety or stress that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

She had been treated for TB (tuberculosis) of the abdomen as her ultrasound of abdomen finding was thicken bowel loop. In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition. But, her neuro problem of numbness in her legs and loss of sensation in legs still continues. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did you also see a dermatologist?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt sounds like your mother has been through a lot. It is difficult to give a definitive diagnosis without a full medical evaluation. However, it is possible that her symptoms are due to a combination of her TB treatment, her fall, and her arthritis. It is also possible that she has developed a peripheral neuropathy due to the TB treatment. I would recommend that she see a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment. The neurologist may recommend further testing such as an MRI or nerve conduction studies to help determine the cause of her symptoms. They may also recommend medications or physical therapy to help manage her symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I am taking Afrin spray for an hour and one pill of Sudafed. I developed a similar condition of cold and sinus infection before six months. I had severe clogging of ears. I was given Amoxicillin for five days and Prednisone 5 mg. My ENT doctor examined my ears and told me that there was no issue with the eardrum. He diagnosed it as eustachian tube issue. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What are your symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt sounds like you may have a chronic eustachian tube dysfunction. This is a condition where the eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the back of the nose, does not open and close properly. This can cause a buildup of fluid in the middle ear, leading to clogged ears and other symptoms. The treatment for this condition is usually a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. Your doctor may recommend a decongestant such as Sudafed to help reduce the swelling in the eustachian tube. They may also recommend a steroid such as prednisone to reduce inflammation. In addition, your doctor may suggest avoiding allergens and irritants that can worsen your symptoms. If these treatments do not help, your doctor may recommend a procedure to open the eustachian tube. This procedure is called a myringotomy.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

My mother is 50 years old. She complains of episodic, sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon. This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother. She has a history of menorrhagia and cycles have become more irregular now. Then, diagnostic D and C was performed last year, which was normal. She will not smoke or drink. She sleeps 4 to 6 hours daily and snores at night.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Does your mother have any other medical conditions?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nBased on the information provided, it is likely that your mother is suffering from a combination of conditions. It is possible that she is experiencing pain in her knees due to osteoarthritis, hip pain due to swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping due to a musculoskeletal disorder, and shoulder stiffness due to a rotator cuff injury. Additionally, her episodic sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon could be due to a tendon injury or tear.

Soon into using the drugs I developed headaches, dizziness, and nausea. I changed the type of PPI three times but the symptoms persisted. The symptoms included a feeling of pressure above my right ear and behind my right eye. Later, I came off the PPIs and after using over the counter headache painkillers for three days the severity of the headaches eased. But the feeling of pressure remains to this day on the right side of the face. I often feel heavy head or even light-headed with a slight dizziness, often as if I am hung over. The symptoms come and go, but are there every day for differing periods of time. And the constant is this feeling of slight pressure on the right side of my head above the ear and extending sometimes down to the cheek and behind the right eye.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n In the past, have you had any medical conditions or operations? Have you had any previous treatments?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the headaches and other symptoms you are experiencing are related to the use of PPIs. It is important to speak with your doctor about your symptoms and to discuss any potential side effects of the medications you have been taking. Your doctor may want to do some tests to rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. Additionally, your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes such as reducing stress, getting adequate sleep, and eating a healthy diet to help reduce your symptoms.

They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22. So everyone on my side of the family has thyroid issues. We were wondering if you could please give us some guidance. Looking to see if we need to eliminate thyroid as a possible cause of his symptoms or if it is worth further pursuit.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of about your son's condition?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the low iodine and selenium levels could be causing thyroid issues, but it is difficult to say without further testing. It is also possible that the low iodine and selenium levels are a result of a dietary deficiency and not the cause of the symptoms. I would recommend speaking to your son's doctor about the possibility of further testing, such as a thyroid ultrasound or a thyroid hormone stimulation test, to determine if there is an underlying thyroid issue. If your son is too anxious to go to the doctor, you may want to consider seeking out a mental health professional to help him manage his anxiety.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

We visited a pediatrician who suggested a dermatologist consultation. I have attached images of the rashes and the prescription. We noticed that it increases in the evenings.

Tell me if this makes sense to you.Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg half pill twice a day, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq once daily, Losartan potassium 25 mg once daily, Warfarin sodium 5 mg once daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg, Digozin 25 mcg once daily and Furosemide 40 mg once daily.I need to know if these medications are fine to take all in one day and if so, I would like to split them into two times a day according to the reactions. I feel that so many medications doing the same thing is redundant and unnecessary and causing problems. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is your father currently taking any other medications?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nThis is a complex question and I would recommend that you speak to your father's cardiologist about his medication regimen. It is important to understand that each medication has a specific purpose and that the combination of medications is tailored to your father's individual needs. It is also important to understand that some medications may interact with each other, so it is important to discuss any changes to the medication regimen with the cardiologist. Additionally, it is important to understand that some medications may need to be taken at specific times of the day in order to be most effective. Therefore, it is important to discuss any changes to the medication regimen with the cardiologist before making any changes.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I have pain in the corner of my left eye for the past one year. I went to the doctor, and he gave me Sterdex. I used it and felt better. My pain went away. After a few months, I started to have pain, but it was not so severe as the first time. I wear glasses and lenses, and I am treating my eye allergy with Chibro Cadron 5 ml, and for dry eyes, I use Fluidabak after taking the lens. Whenever I do my yearly eye checkup, my eyesight gets worse because of the pain in the corner, and I am scared about my sight. I do not know whether I use an appropriate medicine to my eye. Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me the same medication. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n It looks like your doctor is not very clear about the diagnosis.

It is important to have a full eye examination to determine the cause of your pain and to ensure that you are using the appropriate medications. Your doctor may also recommend additional treatments such as lubricating eye drops, antibiotics, or steroid eye drops.

It showed a hianal hernia 2 cm. I am attaching photos. The doctor took biopsies, said no cancer. I have had breast cancer in the past. I am having pain in the chest when I swallow, and sternum today. Will that subside? Is it from the bleeding? And, can you recommend the best pill to take for this pain, taking Pantoprazole now? And what should I take for this problem, what should I eat? (Can you assure there is no cancer)?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n How serious is this?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nI am sorry to hear that you are having pain in your chest when you swallow and sternum. It is difficult to say whether the pain is from the bleeding or not without further information. I would recommend that you follow up with your doctor for further evaluation and treatment. As for the best pill to take for this pain, it would depend on the cause of the pain and your medical history.

I cannot assure you that there is no cancer without further testing, but I can recommend that you follow up with your doctor for further evaluation and treatment.

Even that my appearance is manly but in general my physical built is small compared to other men, my face, hands, legs are small also my voice is feminine.My testosterone level is good. My body is too hairy and I did a testosterone test everything was normal. I know there is a lot of studies that say that testosterone can lead to depression but actually at the age of 21 I was suffering from depression and I took testosterone for a month (to gain muscles), my mood was very good and it actually helped my depression. Also, my sexual life and erection are very good, I do masturbate once or twice every two days and I get an erection easily.Kindly help me with these questions:Will testosterone injections help me be more manly? What is the recommended dose that I have to take monthly? What are testosterone injections made from, are they made from an animal source? Will testosterone affects my personality? Do I have to take it for life? What if after some period I decided to stop will I loose what I gained?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Thank you for your answer. I will forward it to the doctor.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nTestosterone injections can help to increase muscle mass and strength, as well as improve libido and sexual performance. However, it is important to note that testosterone injections are not a \u201cquick fix\u201d and should only be used under the supervision of a qualified medical professional. The recommended dose of testosterone injections will depend on your individual needs and should be determined by your doctor. Testosterone injections are typically made from a synthetic form of the hormone, and not from an animal source. Testosterone injections can affect your personality, but this is usually only in cases of very high doses. If you decide to stop taking testosterone injections, you may experience some side effects, such as decreased muscle mass and strength, decreased libido, and decreased sexual performance. It is important to discuss any potential risks and benefits of testosterone injections with your doctor before starting treatment.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have no fever or other symptoms. Should I be concerned? I had my atlas which was supposedly two degrees off by an atlas orthogonal chiropractor. I originally went in because of my knee and wrist pain then before I knew it, I was having my atlas adjusted by a machine. My last few days I have been miserable and feeling awful. Exhausted, my lymph nodes are so painful on the sides of my neck I have been in bed all day. I just feel this might be related but I do not know.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did the chiropractor give you any medication for the lymph nodes?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the adjustment of your atlas could have caused the swelling and pain in your lymph nodes. However, it is also possible that this is unrelated and could be due to an infection or other medical condition. I would recommend that you see your doctor for an evaluation to determine the cause of your symptoms.

I have had a lot of digestive problems for about two years. I have been diagnosed with candida and dysbiosis but my regular doctor does not seem to know what is wrong with me. I have been very stressed and have suffered anxiety since I was about 16. I was not on any medications and started taking Cymbalta a few months ago.After about three to four days, I started to notice a bit of burning in my feet. I have since stopped taking the Cymbalta about a month ago. My feet seemed fine. Then seven days ago, I have started getting really bad pain in my feet and burning and tickling and pins and needle feelings. I am not diabetic or alcoholic. I have no idea what has brought this on or whether it can be reversed. I am so stressed out. I have to be on my feet for my job for about four and a half hours every morning. Can this be tested to see if the nerve cells are either dead or just damaged and can it be reversed? This feels like it is going to ruin my life. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Doctor, when do you want to see the patient for follow up?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to diagnose your condition without a physical examination and further testing. It is possible that the burning sensation in your feet is related to the stress and anxiety you have been experiencing. It is also possible that the burning sensation is related to the candida and dysbiosis. I recommend that you see a neurologist for further evaluation and testing. The neurologist may be able to determine the cause of the burning sensation and recommend a treatment plan. In the meantime, it is important to manage your stress and anxiety levels. You may want to consider talking to a therapist or counselor to help you manage your stress and anxiety.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

These small red pimples create a red area when seen from far away because they are very small and inflamed. It never disappears. My skin always feels stuck and not flexible and with a mildly itchy or burning sensation. No matter how much moisturizer I apply, it does not help. I am using Eucerin atopic control moisturizer and a gel cleanser with Hyaluronan. I even tried using Metronidazole and tea oil, but again it did not help. I have also tried to stop using anything on my face for some days, but it stayed the same. I am 24 years old now, and I never had acne tendencies when I was a teenager, and my skin always looked very smooth. My birth control pill is still the same as it was when I first started taking it, which wad around ten years ago. I do not use steroid creams nor fluoride toothpaste. How can I get rid of this? It was not there before a year. I am attaching a picture of my face. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to diagnose your condition without seeing you in person. However, it is possible that you are experiencing a skin condition called perioral dermatitis. This is a common skin condition that is characterized by red, inflamed bumps around the mouth, chin, forehead, and nose. It is often caused by the use of topical steroids, which can cause the skin to become irritated and inflamed. It is also possible that you are experiencing an allergic reaction to a product or ingredient that you are using on your skin. If you have not already done so, it is important to see a dermatologist for an evaluation and to discuss treatment options. The dermatologist may recommend a topical cream or ointment to help reduce inflammation and itching, as well as a change in your skin care routine.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I originally felt the pain after playing lots of baseballs (swinging a baseball bat many times). I have symptoms such as tightness, limited mobility or restricted range of motion, throbbing pain, and sometimes it gets so bad that it became hard for me to even walk or sit! I went to my athletic trainer a month ago, and she told me she thinks it is just an aggravated muscle spasm. So she told me to just give it some rest from the activity that hurt it. So I gave it about a month, in which it seemed there was no pain. But as soon as I tried to do the activity that hurt me in the first place, it went right back to hurting. It would be of great help for any assistance. What should I do now?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Please help! What should I do now?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt sounds like you may have a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back. It is important to rest the area and avoid activities that cause pain. You should also consider applying ice to the area for 15-20 minutes several times a day to reduce inflammation and pain. You may also want to take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or naproxen to help reduce pain and inflammation.

I have had a couple of speech therapy sessions but progress is glacial. I am still hoarse and in pain. I have been on 40 mg of Omeprazole for a month and Gaviscon Double Action for two weeks. I feel like the back of my throat is still swollen and I have pain in the corners of my throat. This only briefly eases when I really do some throat opening exercises. I cannot talk for very long without everything getting sore still. I have been like this since the beginning of the year since I had a chest infection and pneumonia. My mouth is now getting sore from all the Gaviscon tablets as the liquid irritates the corners of my throat. I really do not know what else I can do. I am having panic attacks and starting to feel like the only option is to take my life.

It just got worse. I play soccer and that and the sweat is what was irritating it. So I finally went to the doctor and they prescribed me SMZ, TMP DS. I took it for about a week until I realized I was having a lot of side effects and an allergic reaction especially around my mouth. At first I thought I was just breaking out. Then it was not like sores or blisters. I kept self-treating the rash around my mouth and stopped taking the antibiotics. For a couple days it was gone. I was happy. Then I was in the sun one day for soccer and it was just like another rash but worse. I stayed home from school, did not do anything because I just wanted to get it better. But now it looks really bad. I believe I have perioral dermatitis. It is red patches all around my mouth. It is really dry and scaly, also there are like white-heads around my mouth also but they are not whiteheads. I would try to moisturize it with coconut oil or tea tree oil but I think that is what made it worse.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Does the patient have any of the following symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt sounds like you may have developed a contact dermatitis from the antibiotics you were taking. Contact dermatitis is an allergic reaction to a substance that comes in contact with the skin. It is important to avoid the substance that is causing the reaction and to use a mild, fragrance-free moisturizer to help soothe the skin. You should also avoid any further use of coconut oil or tea tree oil, as these can be irritating to the skin. If the rash does not improve with these measures, you should see a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Could you also tell me by perhaps drawing on the shot what waves and shapes indicate problems?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n The report indicates that there is an infarction on the left ventricle and that a stress test was performed.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nThank you for your question. Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a detailed technical analysis of the treadmill stress test result without a more detailed medical history and a physical examination. The infarction seen on the treadmill stress test result could be indicative of a heart attack, but it could also be due to a machine error or other factors. It is important to discuss the results with your doctor to determine the cause and severity of the infarction. Generally, the presence of ST segment depression or elevation, T wave inversion, or Q waves on the ECG tracing can indicate a heart attack. However, it is important to note that the presence of these features does not necessarily mean that a heart attack has occurred.

Recently, I have elevated AST levels. There is no hepatitis or inflammatory diseases, alcohol, drug use, or fatty liver, or Addison\\s.Liver biopsy showed inflammation, but a resolving process likely attributed to a year long Lyme disease treatment with various pharmaceuticals but discontinued two years ago. Liver enzymes dropped to 50 ALT, but have recently elevated to 130 ALT.At this point, there is no known cause. I was told to continue to wait and see. I would like to take a different approach and determine if there is something my hepatologist is not seeing. The current medications are Lamictal and Gabapentin, Trazodone. I had abdominal CT, abdominal MRI, liver biopsy, ultrasounds, and a significant amount of blood work.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Are you the patient?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to provide a definitive answer without more information. However, it is possible that the elevated ALT and AST levels could be due to the medications you are taking. Lamictal and Gabapentin can cause elevated liver enzymes, and Trazodone can cause liver damage. It is also possible that the Lyme disease treatment could have caused some damage to the liver that is still affecting your liver enzymes. I would recommend speaking to your hepatologist about the possibility of changing your medications or reducing the dosage to see if that helps to reduce your liver enzymes. Additionally, it may be beneficial to have further tests done to determine if there is any underlying cause for the elevated liver enzymes.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

If I repeat the HIV test after six months what is the chance of staying negative? I am facing the problem like small bumps in the tongue, from the last two days a little bit of pain below ear region and it is a little swollen. Is it due to HIV?

I am 173 cm. My mother is 173 cm and father is 189 cm. I had a blood test to determine my HGH levels. The doctor asked me for a testosterone and GH test. The result came back a week later and it said that I had a low HGH level and a 21/42 level testosterone. Is this normal for an 18 year old male? I was devastated that my growth plates were closed, because I also had an x-ray of left hand. My doctor asked me whether I am sexually active. I answered him no. But, I got a doubt regarding erectile dysfunction. Am I suffering from erectile dysfunction? Should I be worried? Is my testosterone too low? How can I increase testosterone? I had torsion three years back and nothing back happened. But, this could be a factor. Another factor may be that I used to hold my mobile phone in my pocket all the time.I am a sprint athlete and have defined leg muscles, but this could be due to my short stature. I have gone for another blood test for GH, just as a follow up and that time I was advised to fast for 14 hours. But, I did not fast during my first blood test. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What is your age?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to say whether or not your testosterone levels are too low without knowing more about your medical history and other factors. However, it is possible that your low HGH levels could be contributing to your short stature. It is also possible that your erectile dysfunction could be related to your low testosterone levels, but it is difficult to say without more information. If you are concerned about your testosterone levels, it would be best to speak to your doctor about it. They may be able to recommend lifestyle changes or medications that can help to increase your testosterone levels.

I cannot really recall what exactly happened in a day when nothing special has occurred. I often forget where I put things, even when they are already in front of me, or in my hand.

I think she also has rheumatoid arthritis. For the past five years, she was managing the pain with anti-inflammatory medicine, Lyrica, Mythycobal, Voltaren injections, herbal creams, etc. You can see the veins in her hands popping out. I also realized that the pain has got worse now.For about 12 months the doctor put her only on Prednisolone 5 mg/day and painkiller when necessary. She was fine till last month but the pain increased in her hands now. In the daytime she is fine and the pain starts mildly in the evening. When she lies down in the bed she gets electrical tingling in her legs by which her sleep gets disturbed. She has undergone several tests last week and I attached them for your reference. She did not consult a rheumatologist yet. What medication can I give to reduce the inflammation and cure her? Her ESR, CPR, and ANA are quite high. The pain in her hands and the tingling in her legs at night are agonizing her life. Kindly provide your expert advice.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What medication does your mother currently take?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your mother's condition. It sounds like she is suffering from both fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. The best course of action would be to consult a rheumatologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The tests you have provided suggest that she has an inflammatory condition, which could be causing the pain and tingling in her legs. The rheumatologist may recommend medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to reduce inflammation and pain. They may also suggest lifestyle changes such as exercise, physical therapy, and stress management to help manage her symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}
