It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear you're experiencing these symptoms. Your description suggests that you might have had orchitis, which is inflammation of one or both testes and common in people who get mumps after puberty. Orchitis can indeed result in a decrease in testicle size and potential fertility issues.\n\nWhile it's difficult to definitely say without an examination, the persistence of your symptoms does indicate there may be ongoing issues or complications like chronic epididymitis (inflammation of the tube at the back of the testicle).\n\nIt is essential for you to see a urologist as soon as possible for further evaluation and management. They can perform ultrasound imaging studies or other tests to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment. Avoiding sexual activity till you visit and receive advice from the doctor would also be prudent.\n\nAs for antibiotics, it's best not to self-medicate as this requires a prescription based on a thorough assessment of infection type, severity and your overall health status. An inappropriate antibiotic usage could lead to resistance and make any lingering infection more difficult to treat.\n\nPlease schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider or urologist immediately to address these concerns.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nCocaine generally leaves the body within a few days. It is normally not detectable in blood or saliva tests after 1 to 2 days, and in urine tests it can be detected up to 3 days, but this can extend to about two weeks with heavy use. The half-life of cocaine is relatively short, about 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\n\nIn terms of impact on sperm, cocaine has been found to cause abnormalities in sperm shape, number, and movement, which could potentially affect fertility. There isn't a specific time frame linked to how long cocaine stays in sperm, as such effects depend on individual metabolism and frequency of use.\n\nWhile there aren't definitive guidelines for this situation, it's generally recommended for couples trying to conceive to avoid illicit drugs altogether, because of potential harm to both prospective parents and the potential child. It is advisable to seek further advice from your own healthcare provider who knows your personal circumstances.\n\nIt's also important to consider lifestyle choices that promote healthy fertility. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity, and abstaining from alcohol, tobacco and other harmful substances can all help improve fertility outcomes.\n\nYou should share this information with your healthcare provider so they can provide you with accurate guidance based on their knowledge of your overall health condition.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Have you experienced any of the following symptoms associated with cocaine use?

I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like you're experiencing breakthrough bleeding, which can occur when the hormonal levels in your body fluctuate. When on oral contraceptives like Yaz, skipping sugar pills and prolonging the time before having a period can potentially lead to irregularities including breakthrough bleeding or spotting.\n\nThe brown discharge is likely old blood that didn't fully exit during your period. If it doesn't clear up within a few days to a week, or if you notice other symptoms like an unusual vaginal odor, itchiness, burning sensation, or pelvic pain, contact your healthcare provider as there could be another issue, such as infection or inflammation.\n\nAs for the bleeding during sex, this could also be related to breakthrough bleeding or might indicate cervical irritation. It should subside with your next menstrual cycle. Still, recurrent or heavy bleeding during sex warrants medical attention to rule out more serious conditions like polyps, infection, or rarely, cervical cancer.\n\nIf these conditions persist or cause concern, it would be best to consult with your healthcare provider who might want to adjust your contraceptive regimen or investigate other causes behind these symptoms. \n\nKeep in mind, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation.

I am now very worried what good precautions should I take with him. Can you suggest me what should I do?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour son has a high degree of myopia (nearsightedness), which means he can see things clearly that are close, but things in the distance will look blurred. This condition is fairly common and manageable with corrective measures like glasses or contact lenses. Some precautions and steps you can take include:\n\n1. Regular Eye Check-ups: Ensure he gets regular eye checkups so that any worsening of his myopia can be detected early.\n\n2. Corrective Lenses: Be consistent with use of prescribed eyeglasses or contact lenses. Take care to replace them as advised by the optometrist if your son's prescription changes.\n\n3. Monitor Screen Time: Limit the time spent on digital devices given that excessive screen time can strain eyes and contribute to progressive myopia. Encourage him to take frequent breaks using the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\n\n4. Encourage Outdoor Activities: Increase outdoor activities, as studies have indicated they could slow down the progression of myopia.\n\n5. Good Lighting: Make sure he always reads and writes under good light conditions to limit the strain on his eyes. \n\n6. Healthy Diet: Nurture a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which are beneficial for eye health.\n\n7. Posture: Teach him the correct posture while reading or writing to avoid unnecessary strain on the eyes and body.\n\nThese precautions can help manage your son's condition.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe lump you are describing could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. Postoperative Swelling: After an extraction or a surgical procedure, swelling of the surrounding tissues is common and can sometimes feel like a hard lump. This should subside as the healing progresses.\n \n2. Abscess/Infection: Although not as common since you're already taking Amoxicillin, which is an antibiotic, it's possible that there could have been an infection forming around the extraction site causing this lumpy feel.\n\n3. Bone Spurring: Sometimes after extractions, small sharp pieces of bone can push their way out from the extraction site. These are usually normal, but can feel like a hard lump until they either come fully out or resorb into the body.\n\nGiven that the lower wisdom tooth was removed only six days ago, swelling in the area is still quite normal, especially if the procedure was complex due to the close proximity to the nerve. However, if the swelling doesn't subside, becomes notably worse, or if you develop other signs of infection like fever or intense pain, it is very important to contact your surgeon right away.\n\nAs always, although these are general guidelines, nothing beats a physical examination in person. Therefore, I would advise you to discuss your concern with your oral surgeon. Ensure to maintain good oral hygiene and follow all post-operative instructions given by your dentist. Don't forget to rinse your mouth with warm salt water 2-3 times per day, which can help reduce inflammation\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your information.

It was my first intercourse with a sex worker and I am worrying about expose to HIV. I have started fearing from the minute where I had broken condom intercourse and she said to me that she does not have HIV and they never allow anyone to have sex without a condom because of fear of getting infected. So there is no need to worry but I cannot believe her and started studying about HIV and its symptoms and I have a feeling of infection because I got red dots in my finger pits and cold and throat infection.I want to know what are the red dots on my finger which I got? I got it tested many times in those three months and got a negative result. I am worrying abt six months test.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYou are right to be cautious, as unprotected sex does put you at a higher risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. It's good that you've been testing regularly and currently have negative results.\n\nThe little red spots on your fingers may not necessarily be related to HIV. They could be caused by many things like dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, allergies, or even stress. However, it would be difficult for me to confirm without physically seeing them. You should consult with a dermatologist if these dots persist or develop further symptoms.\n\nCold and throat infection can also come from common viruses and not necessarily linked to HIV. If tested negative multiple times within the three-month window period, it is very likely you are HIV-negative. Current tests are extremely accurate at this point.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that few type of HIV tests will need six months time to detect antibodies. Hence, it is advised to get tested after 6 months as per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation. It's important that you continue to protect yourself moving forward. Your sexual health is crucial so always use protection to reduce the risk of STI transmission. \n\nWhatever the circumstances, you should see your healthcare provider to discuss about your symptoms and concerns. Anytime you engage in high-risk behavior and concerns arise - seek medical help immediately.\n\nRemember that there are medications available called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which can drastically reduce the chance of contracting HIV if started within\n\n## Output (b):\nDo you have any symptoms now other than red dots in your finger?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on the results of your CT scan, it seems like your situation is under control. The small size of these nodules (3 mm and 4 mm), as well as their non-aggressive appearance on imaging, strongly suggest they are benign (non-cancerous). Intrathoracic nodules, such as intrapulmonary lymph nodes or lung nodules, can appear for many reasons other than cancer, including infection, inflammation, or even normal anatomic variations.\n\nThe finding of \"mild thymic hyperplasia\" also suggests a non-malignant process; the thymus sometimes enlarges in response to stress, illness, or normal hormonal changes depending on age.\n\nWhile it's completely understandable that you might find this concerning, at this stage, the appropriate course of action usually involves monitoring rather than aggressive treatment. This would typically involve follow-up CT scans at intervals recommended by a radiologist or pulmonologist to ensure there's no significant growth or change in these nodules.\n\nHowever, remember, this advice is based on limited information and should not replace the advice of your own physicians who have full access to your medical records. Stick with your doctors' plan, but don\u2019t hesitate to ask them more questions if you\u2019re feeling unsure about anything.\n\n## Output (b):\n Did you do any research into your symptoms?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThere are various reasons why your period might be late other than pregnancy. Stress and anxiety can cause changes in your menstrual cycle. Excessive exercise, rapid weight loss or gain, hormonal issues like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid dysfunction can also make your periods irregular. Certain medications including contraceptive pills can alter your cycle too.\n\nSometimes having sex for the first time may induce stress or fear of being pregnant which can result in a delayed period even if you had the negative pregnancy test.\n\nHowever, if this continues to be an issue, it would be best to follow up with your gynecologist for further evaluation. Also, consider using reliable contraception methods if you wish to avoid unwanted pregnancies.\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your answer.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nPhenol, also known as carbolic acid, is a corrosive substance which can cause harm if ingested or in contact with skin. Based on the symptoms your friend has shown (vomiting), it indicates that phenol could have affected his gastrointestinal tract.\n\nContinued symptoms to watch for would include abdominal pain, diarrhea, burns or blisters around the mouth, difficulty swallowing/breathing, dizziness/fainting, and changes in heart rate. Skin exposure can also result in burns, so clean any areas that might've come into contact with phenol with mild soap and water.\n\nThe actions taken so far (vomiting and drinking lots of salty water) in an attempt to mitigate the effects are not recommended without medical supervision since they bring about their own potential risks such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. \n\nAt this point due to the potential severity of phenol poisoning, I highly recommend seeking immediate emergency medical attention even though he vomited after ingestion.

Last week I had brown discharge with mild lower abdominal pain and was prescribed Susten 200 mg (oral). Now, I am feeling the pain frequently in the right lower abdomen with mild bleeding and pain. It is less when I lie on bed. What to do?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms of abdominal pain, mild bleeding, and a recent ultrasound without visible fetal or yolk sac could potentially be suggestive of an early pregnancy complication such as threatened miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy especially should be ruled out due to right lower abdominal pain; it is a condition where the fetus begins to develop outside the uterus, often in a fallopian tube. \n\nWhile Susten 200mg (progesterone) may be administered for threatened abortion or to support early pregnancy, it doesn't eliminate risk completely and not effective against ectopic pregnancies.\n\nThis requires immediate medical attention. You need to see your healthcare provider urgently or consider going to the emergency department. They will probably order blood tests and possibly repeat the ultrasound to monitor your condition closely. Please do not ignore these symptoms and seek help immediately.\n\n## Output (b):\n What medications are you currently taking?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I believe I may be more vulnerable than the average person my age to get Coronavirus, due to my weakened immune system? Should I be self isolating? I am ok to do so\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIf you're living in an area affected by COVID-19, it's prudent to take extra precautions due to your health history and underlying autoimmune condition. This includes practicing good hygiene such as washing your hands regularly, avoiding large gatherings if possible, maintaining social distance from people who are sick, and wearing a mask when necessary. \n\nGiven your medical history, you potentially could be at a higher risk for severe illness if you do contract the virus, so self-isolating can be one measure to reduce exposure. However, not everyone needs to self-isolate unless recommended or required based on travel history, exposure to infected individuals, or showing symptoms of being sick. Please consult with your healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.\n\nIn addition to following general protective measures against the virus, remember to manage your Hashimoto\u2019s disease well, which typically includes taking your medication as prescribed, attending all necessary check-ups, eating healthily, and exercising regularly.\n\nThese recommendations are based on current public health guidelines and may change as more is learned about the virus.

My last ferritin level was 342, 20 days back. My ferritin level has been as high as 390. My TIBC, UIBC, iron, and iron saturation have always been within normal range. My glucose has always ranged from 100 to 104. I was tested for hemochromatosis and results are negative. My doctors keep telling me that we will just watch my ferritin level and I have bloodwork done every six months. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year. I am looking for some answers and some help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nFerritin is a protein that stores iron in your body, and the ferritin test measures the amount of ferritin in your blood. Normally, as you stated, high ferritin levels can indicate conditions where your body stores too much iron. Hemochromatosis is one such condition, but you mention being tested for this with negative results.\n\nElevated ferritin levels can also occur due to inflammation, liver disease, malignant diseases, or other chronic disorders. Since you are diagnosed with fibromyalgia - which is a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body - this could be contributing to your elevated ferritin levels. \n\nHowever, only your healthcare provider who understands your history and clinical profile will be able to piece together these puzzle pieces. Moreover, ferritin can increase depending upon lifestyle factors too like alcohol intake, diet, physical activity levels, etc.\n\nAlso, mildly elevated glucose levels might indicate impaired fasting glucose (pre-diabetes). Please try to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent type 2 diabetes: regular exercise, normal weight, balanced food choices are always recommended.\n\nPlease consult your doctor about any changes in your medical condition or new symptoms.\n\n## Output (b):\n What about your family?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection caused by an imbalance in the normal bacteria found in your vagina. It's true that if left untreated, it can lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, it causing infertility directly is less common. That being said, it is still important to treat BV.\n\nIf standard treatments like Metronidazole or Clindamycin are not working for you, you should certainly revisit your doctor who may explore other treatment options. Refractory BV sometimes requires long-term or recurrent treatments. Don't hesitate to include natural alternatives under supervision, such as probiotics which have been shown to help reestablish healthy vaginal flora.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining excellent genital hygiene might be helpful \u2013 clean your external genital area gently with mild unscented soap, avoid douching, avoid irritants like bubble baths, sprays etc., and ensure underwear are always clean and dry.\n\nYou should also get regularly tested for STIs since having BV may increase your susceptibility to them. Lastly, implementing safe sex practices would be beneficial too, as new sexual partners can alter the bacterial balance in your vagina.\n\nRemember none of this constitutes direct medical advice. It\u2019s crucial you continue discussing your concerns and symptoms face-to-face with your treating physician as they'll provide guidance based on direct examination, tests, and broader medical history.\n\n## Output (b):\n It might be best to start with a general question.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Initially, it used to happen only in winter 4 to 5 years back and then gradually started in rainy days also. Now in summer also while sweating. It is so irritating like that I am going to be mad. I have stopped using soap and also took Clonafit 0.25 mg and Betonix- 10 prescribed by a dermatologist but there is no improvement. Please help me out of this.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like you might be experiencing a condition called aquagenic pruritus or cholinergic urticaria - both of these conditions can cause itching after exposure to water (like after showering) or when the body heats up (like during exercise, resulting in sweating). Aquagenic pruritus and cholinergic urticaria are conditions that often benefit from proper moisturization, anti-itch creams, oral antihistamines, or even prescription medication in more severe cases. \n\nHowever, bear in mind it is crucial to get a year-round, confirmed diagnosis first. I would recommend seeing a dermatologist for an examination if you have not had one recently so that they may confirm exactly what is going on. They may want to perform an allergy test and may also check your liver and kidney function with blood tests as diseases of these organs can sometimes manifest this way. It's important to explore other possibilities such as other types of dermatitis, scabies, thyroid issues, among others. If possible, take note of what seems to trigger the itching and how long it lasts which could provide clues about its source.\n\nRemember, only use medications based on doctor advice and apply a hypoallergenic moisturizer to your skin immediately after getting out of the bath while your skin is still damp. This helps lock in moisture and provides a protective barrier. Additionally, consider using a gentle soap-free cleanser, cool bathing water instead of hot, reduce the duration of your baths/showers, and\n\n## Output (b):\n Please specify the following about the patient's symptoms:\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I'd like to assure you that feeling worried and anxious about these symptoms is perfectly normal. According to your description, it seems you've been thoroughly examined by several doctors and specialists who have ruled out heart conditions and other obvious causes for your discomfort.\n\nThe symptoms you're describing - facial tightness, chest burning sensation, the fact they are relief temporarily by food, alcohol, lying down, or exercising - do not immediately point to one clear diagnosis. Anxiety can indeed create physical manifestations that are very real and sometimes medical tests cannot detect this because it's linked to our nervous system responding to stress.\n\nMusculoskeletal issues (such as tension in the muscles of the neck, shoulders, which then manifests itself on face) could also be plausible especially if you're under a lot of stress or have poor posture. Acid reflux or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) could explain both chest burning and potentially facial discomfort, given its chronic nature, but would usually accompany other gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nOne important thing is that you noticed a decrease in intensity over time, which might suggest improvement. My advice would be to follow up with your primary care physician, continue to monitor the symptoms and their triggers, consider psychological counseling to help manage any potential anxiety, and perhaps investigate more into gastroenterological or musculoskeletal possibilities. If symptoms persist or worsen, further diagnostic testing might be warranted. This is just an opinion based on your description, please consult with your healthcare provider for definitive diagnosis and\n\n## Output (b):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of related to this issue?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

She had been treated for TB (tuberculosis) of the abdomen as her ultrasound of abdomen finding was thicken bowel loop. In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition. But, her neuro problem of numbness in her legs and loss of sensation in legs still continues. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear about the distressing medical situation with your mother. Your mother's clinical case seems quite complicated and must have been overseen by multiple specialized physicians. It sounds like she may have developed peripheral neuropathy as a complication of her TB treatment, which can be caused by certain anti-tuberculosis medications. Her back pain could be due to the compression injury in spine.\n\nAlso, the use of steroids might have led to a rise in blood sugar levels causing the distress regarding breathlessness and hospital admission; this is something often seen in patients on long term steroid therapy. \n\nWhile I'd heavily advise to continue consulting her team of doctors regarding the current status and necessary adjustment of her treatments, considering her complaints of persistent numbness and loss of sensation in legs, a neurological consultation is clearly recommended right away. This condition could be due to several reasons including nerve damage from her TB or its treatment, adverse effect of other medications, diabetes which may have further exacerbated due to steroid usage, or even nutritional deficiencies. A neurologist will do the detailed examination and also decide if any investigations like Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) are necessary.\n\nTake note that controlling her blood sugar levels frequently would be an important part of managing her symptoms as high sugar levels tend to make neuropathic symptoms worse. If arthritis diagnosed, physical therapy along with medication aid could improvise locomotion and relieve some discomfort. \n\nIn complex cases such as these, communication among all her treating physicians is key so the\n\n## Output (b):\n Did you also see a dermatologist?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I was given Amoxicillin for five days and Prednisone 5 mg. My ENT doctor examined my ears and told me that there was no issue with the eardrum. He diagnosed it as eustachian tube issue. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHello,\n\nGiven your current symptoms and past medical history, it sounds like you may be experiencing a similar episode of Eustachian tube dysfunction possibly related to a cold or sinus infection. \n\nEustachian tubes can get blocked due to inflammation from allergies, colds, sinus infections, etc., which might lead to feelings of pressure, fullness or clogging in the ear. Your current treatment with Afrin (a decongestant nasal spray) and Sudafed (an oral decongestant), is generally recommended for managing such conditions.\n\nHowever, if your symptoms persist or worsen, I suggest that you consult with your ENT doctor again. They might want to repeat the use of antibiotics like Amoxicillin if they suspect there is an active underlying infection, or even corticosteroids like Prednisone to alleviate inflammation.

Our first kid is just 1 year old now and it was a Cesarean. We are not in a position to have a second child now. Her LMP was 22nd of last month. I read that Mifepristone can induce abortion. Is it a safe drug? Do we have to consult doctor for taking this drug? What are all the possible side effects? Is that drug 100 percent reliable? Is there any other options? Whether this drug is available without doctor\\s prescription? Thank you.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I cannot recommend inducing an abortion without your wife seeing a healthcare professional. \n\nMifepristone used in combination with misoprostol is commonly used for medical abortions but it should only be taken under the guidance and supervision of a qualified health care provider due to potential complications. The safety and efficacy of this medication largely depend on the gestational age, the dose, and how it's administrated.\n\nSide effects can include heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea among others. While complications are rare, they do exist and can be life-threatening including severe bleeding or infection. \n\nFurthermore, Mifepristone's effectiveness rate is not 100%. On its own, mifepristone is less effective; thus, it is usually given in combine with misoprostol. Together, they are about 95 - 98% effective when administered correctly up until the 10th week of pregnancy.\n\nMoreover, in many countries, Mifepristone and other drugs that induce abortion are typically regulated medicines, which means they must be prescribed by a licensed healthcare provider after determining that the use of these medications is safe and appropriate for the individual patient's situation.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that using this type of medication without consulting her doctor first can lead to significant health risks. Your best option is to consult with your family doctor or gynecologist who can guide you with safe methods taking into account your wife's general health and specific condition.\n\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Where do you live?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My mother is 50 years old. She complains of episodic, sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon. This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother. She has a history of menorrhagia and cycles have become more irregular now. Then, diagnostic D and C was performed last year, which was normal. She will not smoke or drink. She sleeps 4 to 6 hours daily and snores at night.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your description, it seems like your mother is experiencing a multitude of symptoms. The sudden loss of weight bearing ability in the left Achilles tendon indicating some weakness or potential damage which can result from inadequate blood flow, nerve damage or inflammation from diseases such as arthritis and potentially an effects of age.\n\nThe knee and hip pain with swelling could be due to her osteoarthritis or possibly other form of arthritis. Difficulty in movement further indicates this condition causing joint stiffness and immobility.\n\nHer hypertension is reportedly controlled, but she should continue taking her prescribed medication (Bisoprolol and Amlodipine). The kidney stones may be a cause of her lumbar area pain; depending on the size and location of the stones, treatment options may vary.\n\nThe occasional constipation could be related to her diet or potentially certain medications.\n\nYour mother's gynecological history suggests hormonal fluctuations especially with irregular menstrual cycles. This requires close monitoring considering the family's history of uterine cancer.\n\nFor her sleep pattern, if there are signs of distress like difficulty breathing or momentary stops in breathing during snoring, they might suggest presence of conditions like sleep apnea, which would need evaluation.\n\nGiven this complex health scenario, I recommend having a detailed consultation with your mother's primary care provider who can guide you for specialist consultations if required. Please make sure she continues her current medications, maintains adequate hydration and follows a balanced diet. She should also get regular exercise as tolerated considering her joint issues.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Does your mother have any other medical conditions?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Soon into using the drugs I developed headaches, dizziness, and nausea. I changed the type of PPI three times but the symptoms persisted. The symptoms included a feeling of pressure above my right ear and behind my right eye. Later, I came off the PPIs and after using over the counter headache painkillers for three days the severity of the headaches eased. But the feeling of pressure remains to this day on the right side of the face. I often feel heavy head or even light-headed with a slight dizziness, often as if I am hung over. The symptoms come and go, but are there every day for differing periods of time. And the constant is this feeling of slight pressure on the right side of my head above the ear and extending sometimes down to the cheek and behind the right eye.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe symptoms you're describing are consistent with a condition known as a tension headache. Tension headaches result from muscle contractions in the head and neck region, and they can present as pressure right above your ear and behind your eye. It could possibly be triggered by certain medications including PPIs.\n\nHowever, tension headache is just one possibility. There may be other causes like sinus issues which also present with pressure feeling on face and head. Anxiety and stress can also cause similar symptoms. \n\nSince you mentioned these symptoms persist after stopping the PPIs and also because they seem to come and go every day, I would advise you to consult with a neurologist to ensure that there isn't any serious underlying issue such as migraines, or neuralgia etc. \n\nFor now, try relaxation techniques and avoiding stress as much as possible. Stay hydrated and maintain a regular sleep schedule. Remember, it's crucial to seek professional medical advice for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment. These suggestions are made based on your descriptions, but are only meant as general guidance.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n In the past, have you had any medical conditions or operations?

He has no bad breath and he was able to have normal food. Can people with trench mouth have no bad breath and is able to eat normal food?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nTrench mouth, also known as acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), is a severe form of gum disease characterized by painful, infected, bleeding gums and ulcers. Key symptoms often include bad breath (halitosis) and pain upon eating.\n\nHowever, bear in mind that not all individuals with ANUG will necessarily exhibit all symptoms to the same degree. For instance, some people may still be able to eat normally without experiencing significant discomfort, and not everyone with ANUG has noticeably bad breath. \n\nAlso remember that these symptoms are not exclusive to trench mouth; they could indicate other oral health issues too. But regarding your partner's case specifically, if he doesn't have any noticeable symptoms such as painful or bleeding gums, ulcers, or fever, it seems unlikely he has trench mouth. \n\nNonetheless, even without obvious signs, if you suspect there may be a problem, it's best for him to get a check-up with a dentist who can properly diagnose his condition.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Is the patient a man?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22. So everyone on my side of the family has thyroid issues. We were wondering if you could please give us some guidance. Looking to see if we need to eliminate thyroid as a possible cause of his symptoms or if it is worth further pursuit.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nGiven the persistent symptoms and family history of thyroid conditions, it would be wise to further investigate this with an endocrinologist. Even though his blood work came back normal, it's important to remember that the reference ranges for TSH, free T3, and free T4 are quite broad and values within lower or upper limits of the normal range may not be optimal for everybody.\n\nMoreover, as you've indicated his urine test showed low iodine and selenium levels - both elements which are crucial for proper thyroid functioning. Selenium deficiency alone can promote autoimmunity in the context of genetic predisposition, which is relevant considering your family history. \n\nThe possibility of low iodine due to diet and its effect on masking signs of hyperthyroidism is unlikely. Low iodine intake generally leads to hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism because iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. If there was a long-standing severe iodine deficiency, you could potentially see hyperthyroidism when iodine is reintroduced, but this typically happens under very specific circumstances (such as public health efforts to correct severe population-wide iodine deficiency).\n\nSince his fear of doctors might exacerbate existing anxiety, perhaps telehealth visits can help alleviate some of this stress while still providing him necessary medical attention. We should also not overlook the possibility that his symptoms may indeed be panic related, since anxiety disorders can mimic many physical disease processes. Hence, along with endocrine evaluation, psychological assessment could also be considered useful\n\n## Output (b):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of about your son's condition?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

There is a possibility that the discomfort and blocked sensation might be psychological in nature due to stress from the incident, rather than physical. \n\nYou should flush out your nose with saline solution to wash out any residue or foreign substances which could alleviate the blockage.  \nHowever, to rule out anything serious or to further evaluate what exactly might be causing these feelings I would recommend you see an ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat) specialist. They may need to perform an endoscopy (a procedure where they insert a small tube with a light and camera on the end to check inside your nose) to ensure there are no foreign bodies or injury within the nasal cavity.\n\nPlease also seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe pain, swelling, difficulty breathing or swallowing, rash, profuse bleeding or have any other concerns.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer the question regarding the patient's smoking and drinking habits.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Sometimes they occur on my face when I masturbate. If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result.Is it okay to continue this?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nMometasone is a potent steroid that can lead to serious side effects if used inappropriately. Long-term use of this medication may thin or damage the skin and possibly cause other more serious internal side effects. It's not typically used for acne treatment.\n\nFor treating acne, strategies will depend on the type and severity of your acne, as well as your type of skin. This can involve over-the-counter creams and ointments, prescription drugs, or medical procedures. Hormonal changes, such as those experienced during puberty and menstruation, as well as stress, can stimulate sebum production and thereby potentially exacerbate acne. Masturbation does not scientifically cause acne but stress might.\n\nIt's highly recommended to consult with a dermatologist who can provide advice and may be able to prescribe you with more suitable treatments for acne like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids, azelaic acid, or prescription medications like antibiotics.\n\nRemember, don't pick at your acne or wash your face excessively as these actions can actually make conditions worse. Eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water, and maintaining a consistent skincare routine can also help manage your acne.\n\n## Output (b):\n The doctor will be notified once you complete this questionnaire.

It is like a soft pulpy thing. Right now it is small and not causing much pain. When she works too much, she feels a weight on her shoulder and a mild pain like she has lifted a weight. Is that something cancerous?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nWithout an examination and further investigations, it's difficult to definitively diagnose your mother's condition. However, what you're describing could be a lipoma, which is a benign (non-cancerous) soft tissue growth composed of fat cells. Lipomas are usually painless unless they press on a nerve or have blood vessels running through them but can cause discomfort if they grow large.\n\nHowever, there can be other possibilities too. It's important that she see a doctor in person for a proper assessment. They might recommend imaging tests like ultrasound or MRI, and possibly a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Always take lumps and bumps seriously, especially if they change in size, shape or become painful.

My problem is the teeth has become white for the past few years. The back portion of the teeth has become dark or black. Teeth are quite creamy. Often a bad smell spreads out from my mouth. My mother also suffers from this problem. I use whitening toothpaste but all are in vain. So, please doctor help me and give me a suggestion.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your symptoms, it appears you may be suffering from dental decay or caries, which is a bacterial infection of teeth. The black discoloration can occur as the result of consumption of certain foods and drinks (like coffee, tea, cola), tobacco use, inadequate brushing and flossing, or due to a buildup of tartar. \n\nHere are few suggestions:\n\n1. Good oral hygiene: Brush your teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste and floss once a day.\n2. Cut down on sugar: Sugar feeds the bacteria in your mouth, causing it to produce acids that erode enamel and lead to cavities.\n3. Regular dental check-ups: Visit a dentist every 6 months for professional cleaning and check-up.\n4. Balanced diet: Maintain a healthy, balanced diet and drink plenty of water to keep your mouth hydrated and discourage bacterial growth.\n\nSince your mother also suffers from this issue, there could be a genetic component. Oral health problems can sometimes run in families, so both of you should prioritize good oral care habits and regular dental visits.\n\nBad breath can simply be caused by the food we eat, smoking, dry mouth, medical conditions, gum disease, and sinus conditions. Poor oral hygiene can also make you more prone to bad breath.\n\nRegarding whitening toothpaste, they mostly remove surface stains and do not change the inherent color of your teeth. Using abrasive toothpastes excessively can also wear away your enamel over time. Do continue using fluoride toothpaste though as\n\n## Output (b):\n What would you like to know, Patient?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

We visited a pediatrician who suggested a dermatologist consultation. I have attached images of the rashes and the prescription. We noticed that it increases in the evenings. Every morning he wakes up with clear skin and during evenings it worsens. He had a fever for two days around the same time it started. He keeps scratching himself. The severity has reduced, but it is not completely gone.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on the provided information, your child's symptoms could indicate a variety of conditions, ranging from certain types of dermatitis, hives due to an allergic reaction, or even a viral rash such as roseola particularly since you mentioned an accompanied fever. However, without physically examining your child and looking at his patient history in detail, it is hard for me to determine what might be causing the rashes. \n\nPlease make sure that you are following any guidelines that your pediatrician offered in terms of helping alleviate the itching sensation - this could mean using certain moisturizers, keeping him cool as heat might worsen the itchiness, or over-the-counter antihistamines (please do consult with the pharmacist/doctor before giving these to your son). \n\nThe need of further intervention and management depends on whether the situation improves gradually. Also check if there are any new foods, detergents, clothes materials which he has been introduced recently. If anything that potentially can cause allergy should be stopped for now.\n\nLastly, please proceed with the dermatologist consultation as suggested by your pediatrician who might run some tests or take a skin sample (biopsy) to better understand the rash.\n\n## Output (b):\n What do you know about your child's medical history?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am worried.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe choice to treat a fracture with casting, ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation), or buddy taping depends on the location of the fracture, its displacement, instability and involvement of joint. Based on your description, it seems like you have an intra-articular fracture of your fifth metacarpal which is displaced significantly.\n\nGiven these specifics, I understand why you'd be concerned about only having a buddy tape in place instead of a cast or strap. The goal of treatment in these scenarios is often to align the bones so they heal accurately. Buddy taping alone might not provide sufficient realignment and stabilization for a considerably ulnarly-displaced intraarticular fracture. And waiting for the clinic can increase the risk of malunion, where the bone heals incorrectly leading to potential long-term disability, discomfort, and decreased hand functionality. \n\nHowever, without examining you personally or reviewing your images directly, it's difficult for me to give precise advice. What you should do right now is reach out immediately to the medical team already involved in your care. Let them know your pain level, any changes to your symptoms, and your concerns about non-surgical management. It would also be advisable to get a second opinion if possible.\n\nBut regardless, ensure that you're keeping your hand elevated to help reduce swelling, icing it regularly to decrease pain, and avoiding any activities that could further injure the area while you wait.\n\n## Output (b):\n Do you have a fracture?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

It lasted for about four to five days. She then got dengue and on the 14th of this month, had mild spotting for a day and a half. The doctor said it could be the dengue causing the spotting. She has not gotten her periods yet. I have read that there could be bleeding during pregnancy as well.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nA lack of menstruation can be for a variety of reasons. Dengue fever could, in theory, affect a menstrual cycle due to the body being under stress. The spotting that your fianc\u00e9e experienced could also be related to the disease or its treatment.\n\nThat being said, it is equally possible that pregnancy could be causing these symptoms. Both implantation bleeding (which often occurs around the time of a woman's expected period and can sometimes be mistaken for a lighter-than-usual period) and changes in cervical bleeding can cause light vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy. \n\nOther causes of delayed or missed periods include high levels of stress, significant changes in weight, hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions, changes in medication etc.\n\nIt is important for your fianc\u00e9e to see a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis if she doesn't get her periods soon and especially if you both have been sexually active with no contraceptive use. A simple pregnancy test can quickly provide clarity. Please seek immediate medical attention if she experiences severe pain or heavy bleeding.\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your question.

It is only noticeable when I close my left eye, and so I am not sure how long it has taken for this to develop. I am going to see an optometrist and doctor early next week but am currently on the road for work.My main question is that when I look out of the corner of my right eye the blurriness seems to subside and I can see usually. I am wondering if this is a good sign. I have been dealing with severe anxiety the past couple months, and I am worried that might have raised my blood pressure enough to hurt my eyesight.Eyesight when looking with both eyes seems to be normal. I have also noticed floaters in my eyes. Kindly help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms could be due to a number of issues including refractive errors (like nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism), presbyopia (age-related vision changes), dry eye condition, migraines, or retinal conditions. Anxiety can cause physical symptoms, but it wouldn't typically affect eyesight in this way.\n\nWhile it's good that the blurriness seems to subside when looking out of the corner of your eye, that doesn't really give much clinical information about the potential underlying issue. It's important to see an optometrist who can more precisely evaluate your visual acuity, as well as assess any possible medical concerns through a comprehensive eye exam.\n\nThe floaters you mentioned are fairly common and don't always indicate a serious problem. However, if you're seeing a lot of new floaters, or if they're accompanied by flashes of light or peripheral vision loss, then you should seek immediate medical attention as these can be signs of a retinal detachment.\n\nIn the meantime, try not to strain your eyes, take breaks from screens, maintain good lighting when reading or working, and avoid rubbing your eyes. If symptoms worsen before your scheduled appointment, I recommend seeking earlier medical attention.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is it painful?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am 70 kg, 5\\3\" feet.I am currently experiencing shortness of breath, it started a week ago and never went away even though I am taking lagundi or herbal cough medicine 500 mg three times a day after meal.I also feel like I have a lot of phlegm that I cannot release. It just feels heavy on my right chest that passes through my back. I am having paranoia on having COVID-19, but I am afraid to get checked because I might actually get it from the hospital. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's understandable you would be concerned given the current COVID-19 pandemic. The symptoms you described - shortness of breath, chest heaviness, also cough with phlegm - can be seen in various conditions such as pneumonia(including the one caused by COVID 19), bronchitis, and even certain heart problems.\n\nConsidering your age, if you don't have any chronic health conditions and are otherwise generally healthy, acute respiratory infections like bronchitis could be a common cause for these symptoms. However, it's important to rule out COVID-19 considering its prevalence especially if you've had recent contact with someone who tested positive or have traveled to an area with high case numbers.\n\nRemember that diagnosis should not be avoided due to fear of contracting the illness at the hospital. Most healthcare providers have instituted protocols to prevent transmission among their patients. You should call ahead to let them know about your situation so they can guide you appropriately avoiding unnecessary exposures.\n\nWhile you wait to see a doctor, monitor your symptoms closely. If your condition worsens (difficulty breathing becomes severe, persistent chest pain, confusion, bluish lips/face), please seek immediate medical attention as these are signs of an emergency.\n \nKeep in mind this advice is based on the information you provided, and the physician examining you may form different conclusion based upon physical examination and further investigations.\n\n## Output (b):\n Do you know if the patient has any medical conditions?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have a sufficient space for it to grow, and it is growing straight. I do not have pain in the tooth and half of the tooth is poking out now. But I have trouble in opening my mouth fully.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt seems like you might be experiencing a condition known as Pericoronitis. This is an inflammation of the gum tissue that often occurs when a wisdom tooth (also known as third molar) partially erupts but leaves a flap of gum covering part of the tooth, where food can become trapped and cause a localized infection.\n\nDifficulty in opening your mouth could be due to the swelling associated with this condition, or it could be a symptom of Trismus - a restriction to mouth opening as a result of masticatory muscle or joint inflammation or damage, often linked to dental infections or procedures.\n\nWhile waiting for appointment with a dentist, some measures such as good oral hygiene including brushing and flossing regularly, using a warm salt water rinse several times a day, and over-the-counter pain relievers could potentially help ease these symptoms. Please do not delay seeing a dental professional since untreated pericoronitis can lead to serious complications such as spread of infection. They'll be able to definitively diagnose your issue and provide appropriate treatment options.\n\nPlease note: this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation.

I had two I-pills in one month. After the first I-pill, I got withdrawal bleeding after five days. It lasted for four days and the flow was normal. After 14 days of this incident, I again had protected sexual intercourse and took another I-pill after 36 hours. But this time even after 11 days, there is no withdrawal bleeding. Is this because of hormonal imbalance or pregnancy?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe emergency contraceptive pill, or \"morning-after pill,\" contains hormones that can prevent pregnancy by delaying ovulation or preventing fertilization. It is common to experience alterations in your menstrual cycle after taking the I-pill due to its hormonal impact. These changes can include spotting, early periods, late periods, or even missed periods.\n\nIt's difficult to say for certain whether the lack of withdrawal bleeding this time around is due to a hormonal imbalance caused by taking two I-pills within a month, or if it could possibly indicate pregnancy. Given that you had protected sex and took an emergency contraceptive, the chances should be relatively low, but no method is 100% effective. \n\nI would recommend doing a home pregnancy test for your peace of mind. If the test comes out negative and you still don't get your period, consider seeing a healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms/condition. Remember, repeated use of emergency contraception can lead to irregular cycles and unpredictable bleeding patterns. They are not recommended as a regular form of contraception despite their effectiveness. It would be useful to talk about more consistent forms of birth control with your doctor.\n\n## Output (b):\n What is your answer?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Is it advisable to wait for one month to be seen by my gynecologist or go to an urgent care right away?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nRecurrent vaginal discharge could be due to a persistent infection or other underlying conditions. It's notable that antibiotics can sometimes lead to a yeast infection as they eliminate not only harmful bacteria but also some of the good bacteria in your vagina, allowing for an overgrowth of yeast. \n\nIf you are experiencing discomfort, itching, or other symptoms along with the discharge, it would be advisable to see a healthcare provider sooner rather than later. You don't necessarily have to go to urgent care, unless the symptoms are severe or unmanageable, but you should definitely try to see a physician more immediately than waiting out the whole month.\n\nHowever, if there are no other troublesome symptoms and the condition isn't affecting your daily life, it might be okay to monitor the situation while waiting for your gynecologist's appointment. Make sure to maintain adequate personal hygiene, wearing loose fitting, cotton underwear and avoid using scented soaps or feminine sprays until your appointment.\n\nPlease remember this advice is quite general.

Then had two heart valves repaired and they want to put a stent in. His list of medications does not seem to make sense and although he loves his cardiologist. I do not think he is paying enough attention. I am in the medical field and although I am not a pharmacist or an M.D. I know a little bit about adverse drug reactions. Tell me if this makes sense to you.Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg half pill twice a day, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq once daily, Losartan potassium 25 mg once daily, Warfarin sodium 5 mg once daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg, Digozin 25 mcg once daily and Furosemide 40 mg once daily.I need to know if these medications are fine to take all in one day and if so, I would like to split them into two times a day according to the reactions. I feel that so many medications doing the same thing is redundant and unnecessary and causing problems. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe medications listed are fairly typical for someone with a heart attack, stroke and heart valve disease. They each have different roles:\n\n1. Metoprolol tartrate: This is a beta blocker which is used to lower blood pressure, but also slows down the heart rate and decreases the work on the heart.\n2. Potassium Chloride: This is often prescribed due to the effects other medications like Lasix (Furosemide) can have on lowering potassium levels in the body. Maintaining a healthy potassium level is important for normal heart rhythms.\n3. Losartan potassium: This is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) effective at blood vessel dilation and relieving high blood pressure. \n4. Warfarin sodium: This is an anticoagulant (\u201cblood thinner\u201d) used to maintain a somewhat 'thinner' blood consistency to minimize risk of clots leading to further stroke or heart attack.\n5. Atorvastatin (a \u201cstatin\u201d): Used to lower cholesterol and prevent build up of plaque on arterial walls.\n6. Digoxin: Helps control irregular heartbeat and reduces symptoms of heart failure.\n7. Furosemide: A diuretic generally used to eliminate excessive fluid retention especially in heart failure situations.\n\nAppending to that, taking all these medications in one day isn't likely to cause harm in itself, but they each do need to be taken as directed, because some interact with others.

Keep in mind not to self-medicate as it can potentially worsen your condition. Also, remember not to put anything into your ears (like cotton swabs) trying to clean, because you might push the infection deeper or perforate your eardrum accidentally.\n\nIn the meantime, maintaining good hygiene by washing the outer part of your ear with mild soap and water, avoiding swimming pools, and not using headphones or hearing aids until the infection has cleared up completely are recommended.

Basically, I break out when the climate I am in is hot, or when I exercise. I visited my family doctor and he told me to get a blood test and he also gave me a Cetirizine (Zyrtec) prescription which is 20 mg. I have been taking this medication for about four days now, and I still get these itchy hives. If I were to get a blood test, will the doctor be able to prescribe the right medication, so I can get rid of these annoying hives?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's important to continue with the prescribed medication even if you don't see immediate results. It can take up to several weeks for certain medications, including antihistamines like Cetirizine, to fully control symptoms.\n\nThe blood test your doctor ordered will likely help determine whether there may be an underlying cause for your chronic urticaria. Some possible causes include autoimmune diseases, infections, or other allergies. Knowing the root cause of your hives will aid in tailoring the most effective treatment plan.\n\nIf the Zyrtec continues to not alleviate your symptoms after a couple weeks, revisit your doctor so they can adjust your dosage or recommend a different kind of medication altogether. In more severe cases, doctors might consider prescribing H2 blockers or leukotriene antagonists. Corticosteroids could also be used in short courses for extreme flare-ups; however, long-term use is generally avoided due to potential side effects.\n\nIn addition, I'd encourage you to try identify and avoid triggering factors that contribute towards your hives - e.g., heat, certain foods, stress etc. This, along with the right medication, should help you manage your chronic urticaria better.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the most common time of day for the symptoms to occur?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

But as it is not showing any problem so I left it till now. But now I want to go for hydrocele surgery. Also, I want to know any other methods except surgery which can be done to finish hydrocele. Now I am also going to gym and doing some physical exercise there. Is there any problem with it? My age is 27 years, height is 5\\10\" and weight is 83 kg.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nA hydrocele is a type of swelling in the scrotum that occurs when fluid collects in the thin sheath surrounding a testicle. Hydroceles are usually painless and often don't require treatment. However, if you've decided to opt for surgery, it's generally considered safe and effective.\n\nOptions besides surgery can include watching and waiting or aspiration and sclerotherapy. With monitoring, as long as they aren't causing discomfort, there's not typically any problem with leaving them untreated. Aspiration and sclerotherapy involves drawing out the fluid with a needle and then injecting a chemical into the sac to prevent more fluid from accumulating. It isn't as widely used because it has higher rates of recurrence and complications compared to surgery.\n\nGoing to the gym and working out shouldn't be an issue with having a hydrocele, but certain exercises like those involving heavy weights, might increase intra-abdominal pressure and thus exacerbate the symptoms. So, while light exercises should be fine, do ensure to avoid heavy lifting.\n\nIn all scenarios, I recommend discussing this thoroughly with your healthcare provider who can properly evaluate you and provide advice tailored specifically to your condition.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please type anything else you want to tell the doctor.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Should I get worried about it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's important to understand that even protected sex with a stranger can run the risk of transmitting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially if there were any mishaps with the protection used. The inflammation in your urinary tract may be due to an STI or it might just be a simple Urinary Tract Infection (UTI).\n\nThis doesn't mean you should start worrying excessively, but you absolutely do need to seek medical attention as soon as possible. If it is indeed a UTI, these are usually easy to treat with antibiotics. However, if it turns out to be an STI, proper treatment is critical to avoid complications.\n\nIn the meantime, reduce discomfort by drinking plenty of water and avoiding irritants like coffee, alcohol and spicy foods.

I have taken unwanted 72 on the third day morning after having breakfast. But, still, my periods have not yet started. Can you please help me out with the reason behind that?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nEmergency contraceptives like Unwanted 72 can alter your menstrual cycle. This means after taking it, your next period could either start earlier or get delayed. The delay can be up to one week. If it's longer than a week or you have other symptoms (like nausea, breast tenderness), then you should take a pregnancy test to rule out the possibility of pregnancy.\n\nPlease note that emergency contraception pills should only be used as an emergency measure and not as a regular method of contraception. Regular unprotected sex carries risks of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unplanned pregnancies. Always use protection to maintain good reproductive health.

What does that mean or what could it be?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms may suggest a variety of gynecological conditions such as endometrial polyps, uterine fibroids, hormonal imbalances or potentially a miscarriage (if there's a chance you could have been pregnant). The passing of grey tissue could possibly be the lining of the uterus that has shed (endometrium) if it was not a miscarriage. This should not be taken lightly and I highly recommend seeing a healthcare provider soon in order to get an accurate diagnosis. They can guide you through any necessary tests such as blood tests, ultrasounds or other appropriate examinations based on their clinical judgement.\n\n## Output (b):\n Do you smoke?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

He has nasal blockage for the past two weeks. Now, he has developed a fever. His throat and tonsils are swollen. We took him to a doctor. The doctor prescribed him Benadryl 5 ml and Crocin DS 7.5 ml. He has not given any antibiotics. Is it fine? Please suggest.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe doctor's prescription of Benadryl and Crocin DS seems appropriate at this stage. Benadryl will help with his nasal blockage as it is a decongestant, and Crocin DS (which contains paracetamol) will help to reduce his fever.\n\nHowever, the persistence of symptoms for two weeks and the present swollen tonsils might indeed suggest a bacterial infection like strep throat, which would typically need an antibiotic for treatment. Sometimes, clinicians wait for symptoms to persist beyond a certain point before starting antibiotics.\n\nNevertheless, if your son's condition doesn't improve or worsens after few days of administering these medicines, I advise you revisit your pediatrician. They may reassess the situation and consider starting antibiotics if necessary. Also, make sure your kid rests and gets plenty of fluids.\n\n## Output (b):\n Was your son recently exposed to any cold or allergy?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I just woke up from a nap, and the vision in my left eye is blurry. It has not cleared up in the past half an hour. Twice over the years, this has happened, and it normalized over a few hours, but I am in a jungle now. So, I would like to err on the side of caution. I have had previous retinal detachments.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nSudden blurred vision in one eye could be a serious medical emergency considering your history of retinal detachments. Though it has resolved on its own in the past, you shouldn\u2019t rely on this happening again. The symptoms can indicate various conditions from less dangerous like dry eyes or refractive errors to potentially more severe conditions such as optic neuritis, macular degeneration, but in your case, it might signal a retinal detachment which is a significant concern and needs an immediate evaluation by an eye specialist.\n\nWithout having proper tools and clinical examination at hand I advise you to protect your vision by lowering physical activity, avoid bending down and certainly no heavy lifting. Keep your head up, at heart level generally. Do not rub your eyes too. \n\nI would strongly advise that you seek urgent professional medical assistance as soon as possible if you are able to leave the jungle or perhaps there's any possibility of communicating with services that may assist you in reaching a hospital urgently. It should not be taken lightly given your medical history and current context.\n\n## Output (b):\n Hello, Doctor, the patient's vision is cloudy and it is itchy.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My right hand and right shoulder directly hit the road and cause severe pain on the right side of the abdomen. A local doctor prescribed some medicine and I got relieved from my side pain. I went for an x-ray of the right chest, it was normal. But after 36 hours I am having pain in the right shoulder (scapula) and while sitting, or arising out of bed, or moving hand on the upper side the pain increases a lot. Is it normal or need better medical assistance?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nPain after a fall like yours is certainly not unusual. You may have bruised or strained the muscles and tissues around your right shoulder and scapula, which would explain the pain you're feeling, especially when moving in certain ways. \n\nHowever, given that the pain appears to be worsening or at least persisting after 36 hours, it's prudent to seek further medical evaluation. This could signify something more serious, such as a fracture which might not have been apparent on an X-ray at first due to swelling or inflammation, or a rotator cuff injury which would require specific physical therapy or possibly surgery.\n\nEven if there is no major damage, seeing a doctor could provide peace of mind and possible pain relief strategies such as physiotherapy or targeted exercises. Please get some professional help with this, particularly if the pain continues to increase or does not improve with rest and over-the-counter pain medications.\n\nAlso, consider watching for any signs of nerve injury such as weakness, numbness or tingling in your arm or hand.

This month: BG 110 mg/dl, GTT one hour 184 mg/dl, two hours 115 mg/dl, morning insulin 5.3 \\xce\\xbcU/ml. Every other blood test within normal ranges. I am male 32 years old 1.86 cm 93 kg 13 to 14 % body fat athletic with healthy nutrition habits. No history of diabetes in the family. Could I be having cancer in pancreas judging from the insulin values you are seeing? I have had many years to do a blood test and with this random one seven months ago. I was told by my doctor that I had to keep monitoring my blood glucose since I could develop diabetes later on, and since I have never had a problem with blood sugar as a kid and no family history of diabetes, I was wondering what might be going on cause insulin levels dropped from my last test and since my diet was pretty much same with healthy choices why is this happening. My doctor for the last seven months kept telling me to calm down and that I do not have anything cause stressing is bad for my blood glucose too. Should I be telling him to get a pancreas MRI done?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your lab results, it seems like you're showing signs of impaired glucose tolerance. Your recent blood glucose test shows that after drinking a sugar drink, your blood glucose is higher than normal but not enough to be classified as diabetes.\n\nThis could be an indicator for prediabetes - a condition where blood glucose level is higher than normal but not high enough to diagnose type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes can progress into type 2 diabetes, and weight loss through healthy eating and exercise can halt or reverse this progression.\n\nYour insulin levels are within the standard range, albeit toward the lower end. A gradual decline in insulin levels may suggest your pancreas isn't producing as much insulin, although this can also be due to several other factors including diet, stress, sleep etc. \n\nHaving said this, these lab results do not point towards a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer symptoms usually include abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice) among others, which you have not reported here. However, if you are still concerned it's always good to discuss with your doctor about your worries.\n\nPlease note that simply having low insulin does not mean one has pancreatic cancer. Also, MRI should only be ordered when there is a substantial reason or suspicion based on multiple indicators, not merely what might seem as mild changes in insulin levels. This radiological examination comes with its own set of risks and shouldn't be used as first-line diagnostics without proper indications.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I keep pushing it with my tongue and clenching a bit against it and I just noticed that it has become loose little more. I have my wisdom teeth and I think it might be applying pressure forward on these teeth. I read in a book that day grinding can cause a teeth to loosen, which is easier to treat. There is no pain and the teeth look healthy. I always clench my teeth but it never caused any looseness.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms suggest that you may have bruxism or teeth grinding, which could be causing your loose molar. Pressure from wisdom teeth can also contribute to the problem. It's good news that there's no pain and the tooth appears healthy visually.\n\nHowever, a loose tooth is not something you should ignore. The mobility could increase over time, potentially risking your oral health. Proactive steps should be taken to prevent further loosening.\n\nYou should make an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible. They might recommend a night guard to protect your teeth if you grind or clench at night. If the pressure from your wisdom teeth is contributing to the problem, you may need to have them removed.\n\nIn the meantime, avoid putting extra pressure on the tooth - try not to push it further with your tongue or chew on that side of your mouth. Follow an effective plaque control regime: brush gently twice a day and floss daily to maintain good oral hygiene. This won't treat the looseness but will help prevent further damage.\n\n## Output (b):\n What about your diet?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

She has five brown marks, two of them are 2 cm size and the other three of 0.5 cm. They are irregular in shape. Initial two marks appeared when she was 3 months old and now when she is 9 months three more for added that are comparatively light and 0.5 cm of size. Are these birthmarks? Will they fade with the time? Do we need to take any precautions so that they do not increase or get added further? Can we also provide any medication to cure them?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour baby might have what we call congenital melanocytic nevi. These are essentially birthmarks that can vary in size and color, often brown, and generally appear at birth or soon afterward. While the exact cause isn't determined, they're thought to form as a result of skin cells failing to grow normally during their development.\n\nMost of these marks are harmless and do not require treatment. They may fade or darken with age, but typically they do not completely disappear. A small number of these nevi have an elevated risk for becoming cancerous later in life, especially large ones.\n\nYou should consult your pediatrician or a dermatologist who can examine them closely. If there is any concern regarding changes in shape, size, or color, they might advise regular monitoring or even a biopsy in some cases. However, with the sizes you mentioned, it's less likely.\n\nThere is no specific medication to cure them, as they are benign skin lesions. It would be best not to avoid sun exposure and apply sunscreen on your child if she's out in the sun.\n\nRemember, this advice doesn't substitute a proper consultation. It's always better to get her examined by a professional healthcare provider.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n If you are a patient, please provide as much information about your symptoms and conditions as possible.

You may be dealing with some type of dermatitis, psoriasis or possibly an allergic reaction. The fact that Hydrocortisone Cream hasn't helped might suggest this rash isn't completely responsive to steroids, or it may simply mean that you need something stronger. It's also possible that it's infected, in which case a topical antibiotic could be needed.\n\nAlways remember to avoid scratching the area as much as possible. If itch is a problem, antihistamines such as Benadryl might help though they can cause drowsiness. \n\nHowever, given that there has been no improvement thus far, I strongly recommend that you make an appointment with a dermatologist for a physical examination as soon as possible so you can get a firm diagnosis and treatment plan.

They started a root canal but then did not finish. I have gone back several times and every time they open up the tooth and insert medicine. My tooth is in agony right now. I am just wondering if this is a standard procedure during a root canal? Should not the dentist remove the nerves so I am not in so much pain? Or is it the standard procedure to fight the infection first and then remove the nerves?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nGenerally, a root canal treatment involves creating an opening in the tooth to reach and remove the infected pulp (which is comprised of nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues), then cleaning and shaping the inside of the root canals, followed by filling and sealing the space. This procedure usually eliminates the pain you're experiencing as with the pulp removed, there are no more nerves in that tooth to transmit pain signals.\n\nHowever, sometimes if there's a severe infection or abscess at the end of the roots of your tooth, your dentist might not complete the whole process in one visit. They may instead use a temporary filling material and place medication within the tooth to help with the inflammation and infection before completely removing the pulp and finishing the root canal. \n\nBut continuous instances where the dentist re-opens the tooth and inserts medicine can also likely indicate complications or failure of the initial attempt at treating the tooth. One key point though - you should not be in \"agony\". Pain during a root canal is common but this should be manageable with over-the-counter analgesics, and should not extend for longer than a few days after each intervention.\n\nIn any case, persistent severe pain suggests something is not right. You may want to seek a second opinion from another dentist or consult with an endodontist (a specialist in root canal treatments) about your issue. Remember that all these suggestions are based on generic information and actual advice may vary depending upon various factors related to individual health conditions.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n The doctor is ready to help you.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have pain in the corner of my left eye for the past one year. I went to the doctor, and he gave me Sterdex. I used it and felt better. My pain went away. After a few months, I started to have pain, but it was not so severe as the first time. I wear glasses and lenses, and I am treating my eye allergy with Chibro Cadron 5 ml, and for dry eyes, I use Fluidabak after taking the lens. Whenever I do my yearly eye checkup, my eyesight gets worse because of the pain in the corner, and I am scared about my sight. I do not know whether I use an appropriate medicine to my eye. Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me the same medication. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt seems like you're dealing with recurrent eye pain which may be associated with prolonged use of contact lenses, dryness of the eyes, allergies or other underlying conditions. The medications you are using, Sterdex is a combination antibiotic and steroid used to treat inflammations in the eye, Chibro Cadron 5 ml is used for eye inflammation and Fluidabak is used to relieve symptoms of dry eyes.\n\nGiven your situation, I would advise a re-evaluation by an ophthalmologist. An eye exam including visual acuity test, slit lamp examination (a detailed view of the structures at the front of your eye), tonometry (check for glaucoma) and possibly a fundoscopy (examination of the back of your eye) will be required.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Limit your usage of contact lenses\n2. Maintain hygiene while handling lenses\n3. Use artificial tears on a regular basis throughout the day.\n4. Update eyeglasses prescription if needed and try using glasses more often than contacts.\n\nAgain, it's very important you seek a consultation with an ophthalmologist to review your medication and confirm there are no serious conditions associated with your recurring eye discomfort. It's critical that this gets addressed to prevent any potential long-term damage to your eyesight.\n\n## Output (b):\n It looks like your doctor is not very clear about the diagnosis.

It showed a hianal hernia 2 cm. I am attaching photos. The doctor took biopsies, said no cancer. I have had breast cancer in the past. I am having pain in the chest when I swallow, and sternum today. Will that subside? Is it from the bleeding? And, can you recommend the best pill to take for this pain, taking Pantoprazole now? And what should I take for this problem, what should I eat? (Can you assure there is no cancer)?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nUnfortunately, as an AI, I cannot view physical attachments such as photographs. But based on the information you provided, it sounds like you might be experiencing some discomfort due to the EGD procedure itself; this is quite common in many patients and should subside over time. The chest pain when swallowing could be related to irritation caused by the endoscope or the polypectomy.\n\nRegarding medication, Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) commonly used for conditions involving excess stomach acid, including hiatal hernias. This one should help with your symptoms. If the chest pain continues, I would recommend reaching out to your treating physician who might consider a short course of a mild painkiller if there are no contraindications. \n\nIn terms of diet, eating smaller meals more frequently, reducing fatty and spicy foods, and avoiding lying down immediately after eating can all be beneficial in managing hiatal hernia symptoms.\n\nAbout your cancer concern: if the doctor took biopsies during the EGD and confirmed no presence of cancer, that's very reassuring. However, keep in mind that your gastroenterologist knows your situation best. Considering your past history of breast cancer, continue following up regularly with both your primary care doctor and oncologist.\n\nRemember, online advice does not substitute an office visit, so please reach out to your personal doctor regarding these issues.\n\n## Output (b):\n How serious is this?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am 173 cm in height and weighs about 68 kg. I would like to know about testosterone injection if I took it in a small dosage weekly will that help my appearance to be more manly? Even that my appearance is manly but in general my physical built is small compared to other men, my face, hands, legs are small also my voice is feminine.My testosterone level is good. My body is too hairy and I did a testosterone test everything was normal. I know there is a lot of studies that say that testosterone can lead to depression but actually at the age of 21 I was suffering from depression and I took testosterone for a month (to gain muscles), my mood was very good and it actually helped my depression. Also, my sexual life and erection are very good, I do masturbate once or twice every two days and I get an erection easily.Kindly help me with these questions:Will testosterone injections help me be more manly? What is the recommended dose that I have to take monthly? What are testosterone injections made from, are they made from an animal source? Will testosterone affects my personality? Do I have to take it for life? What if after some period I decided to stop will I loose what I gained?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nTestosterone is the primary male sex hormone that plays key roles in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics like increased muscle and bone mass, and body hair growth. However, the use of testosterone injection should ideally be for those diagnosed with low or no testosterone because its misuse can lead to serious side effects.\n\n1. Testosterone could potentially make your appearance more \"masculine\" by increasing muscle mass and thickening your voice to some extent if it happens to be related to low testosterone levels.\n2. Only a healthcare professional can advise on appropriate dosage based on individual health conditions and needs. Because your testosterone levels are normal, it's not advisable to take extra testosterone without medical consultation.\n3. Testosterone used in injections isn't derived from animals; it's lab-synthesized to be bio-identical to human testosterone.\n4. As for personality changes, testosterone may influence mood and might cause increased aggression or competitiveness, but there's variability in individuals' responses.\n5. Unless you suffer from lifelong hypogonadism (where the body doesn't produce enough testosterone), you wouldn't necessarily need to take it for life. In fact, inappropriate usage can shut down your natural testosterone production, making you dependent on these injections for normal function.\n6. If you discontinue the injections after a while, the newly acquired features might diminish over time.\n\nGiven your presented information - normal testosterone level & overall good health, self-administering\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your answer.

Which is better at combating bad breath due to smoking than alcoholic? I am in a hygiene school and want to know whether or not to recommend non-alcohol mouthwash for the complaints of bad breath from smoking. I have recommended tongue scraping, alcoholic mouthwash. Anyways, they are not going to stop smoking or drinking. I was looking at a way to have them not dry out the tissues, but stopping the obvious factors do not seem to be an option.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBoth alcoholic and non-alcoholic mouthwashes are designed to kill bacteria in the mouth that cause bad breath, plaque, and gingivitis. However, they do vary slightly in their makeup and mode of action.\n\nAlcohol-based mouthwash has a high alcohol content which can help it to penetrate oral biofilms better and kill bacteria effectively. In addition to killing bacteria, alcohol also acts as a carrier agent for essential active ingredients like menthol, eucalyptol, and thymol which helps them permeate plaque.\n\nHowever, these alcohol-based mouthwashes can make the mouth dry by reducing saliva production over time. This can lead to more bad breath since saliva naturally counteracts bacteria and acid in the mouth. Alcohol can also irritate soft tissues in the mouth. \n\nNon-alcoholic mouthwash, on the other hand, often contains ingredients like cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) that kill bacteria without drying out the mouth. It doesn't contain alcohol, so this type could be more comfortable for those with sensitive mouths. Many tend to prefer non-alcoholic mouthwash because they find it less harsh to swish around in their mouth.\n\nGiven your concern about dehydration of oral tissues from smoking and alcohol use, recommending non-alcoholic mouthwashes may be beneficial for your patients. They should, however, still complement this with good dental hygiene practices such as regular brushing and flossing and tongue scraping. It\u2019s always best for an individual to consult with their dentist or hy\n\n## Output (b):\n Have you considered throat sprays?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My eyes still yellow. Is it unlikely hematologist who diagnosed me three years ago misdiagnosed? I do not doubt he knows his stuff. More about me getting worried. I lost weight a couple of months ago. I went very yellow in the eyes. I have always felt tired. I have had gallbladder out four years ago, I bruise easily, I do get little red skin dots at times, menstrual cycles can be irregular and spleen slightly enlarged.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nPatients diagnosed with hereditary spherocytosis typically exhibit a range of symptoms similar to yours, such as jaundice (yellowing of the eyes), fatigue, easy bruising, red blood dots (petechiae) and an enlarged spleen. These issues result from increased hemolysis or breakdown of red blood cells that are characteristic of this disease.\n\nWeight loss is not directly associated with hereditary spherocytosis; however, it may be indirectly related due to decreased appetite caused by feelings of discomfort or chronic anemia-related fatigue. The irregular menstrual cycle might also be indirectly related through hormonal imbalance induced by stress and long-term illness.\n\nThe removal of your gallbladder probably was done because individuals with hereditary spherocytosis have a higher risk of developing gallstones.\n\nIt's normal to feel worried about a chronic health condition like this. I would advise you reach out to your hematologist and discuss these concerns. It can also help to keep track of your symptoms and bring up any changes during your appointments. With proper management, most people with this disease can lead normal lives while managing their symptoms. The possible misdiagnosis is unlikely given your listed symptoms are consistent with hereditary spherocytosis. However, if necessary, genetic testing can offer conclusive evidence of this diagnosis.\n\n## Output (b):\n What about your eyes?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My ovary is bulky with right ovary volume 11.5 cc and left ovary volume 11.2 cc. I am suffering from PCOD. I am under treatment for the past three months. Can I get pregnant naturally?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nPolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) can make it more difficult to become pregnant naturally because it may interfere with regular ovulation, which is necessary for conception. However, this does not mean it's impossible to get pregnant. Many women with PCOS have been able to conceive naturally or with the assistance of fertility treatments.\n\nThe fact that you are under treatment is positive, and often changes like eating a healthier diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity can improve your body's response to insulin and help reduce symptoms of PCOS, potentially aiding in natural fertility.\n\nAlso, medications like Clomiphene citrate or Metformin might be suggested by your doctor to stimulate ovulation if lifestyle changes aren't enough on their own. \n\nRemember to consistently keep in touch with your gynecologist about your concerns and progress. This discussion will assist them in determining the best course of action for your particular case.

I am using Clotrimazole cream over the infection. Once I miss applying cream a day, the penis gets infected with red patches, pus-filled boils and there is severe itching. My partner is not affected by any problem though we are sexually active. I am not diabetic when I saw my blood test. Kindly help me to cure it. I am frustrated with my problem. Kindly give me medical advice.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm really sorry to hear about your condition. It sounds incredibly uncomfortable and distressing. A recurring infection of the kind you're describing could possibly be a yeast infection or balanitis, especially given that it seems to respond to Clotrimazole, which is an antifungal cream.\n\nHowever, due to the recurrent and severe nature of your symptoms (red patches, pus-filled boils, severe itching), it would be advisable for you to see a healthcare professional in person - preferably a urologist or dermatologist. You may require stronger antifungal medication or antibiotics if there's also a bacterial infection, but this needs to be determined by a doctor who can examine the affected area and perhaps take a swab for testing.\n\nIn addition, even though you said your partner doesn't seem to be affected, they may still need to get checked just in case they're asymptomatic, meaning not showing any signs yet carrying the infection - because this particular infection can potentially be transmitted sexually.\n\nPlease use condoms until both of you are cleared from potential infectious causes to prevent passing the infection back and forth.\n\nDo maintain good hygiene \u2013 clean the penis thoroughly but gently with lukewarm water every day. Do not use soap directly on the area as it can worsen the irritation. Dry it well before applying any cream. \n\nRemember, keep away from self-diagnosing or self-medicating.

I experienced an episode that lasted roughly about two to three minutes where I felt that I could not seem to catch my breath and it felt as if my heart had stopped beating. I checked my heart rate roughly three minutes after the incident and it was at 60 bpm and my oxygen was at 99 % under two weeks ago. I had a routine 24 tape which was clear (ectopic beats picked up but were benign). I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. However, they generally come on during stressful situations. Could this be a panic attack symptom? I also wanted to add that this happened during intercourse (I am a 35-year-old male, height is 174 cm and weight is 100 kg). I look forward to your response and suggestions.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on the information you've provided, it's very possible that the episode you described was indeed a symptom of a panic attack. Panic attacks can manifest in many different ways and often mimic physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations or even chest pain.\n\nSexual activity can be intense and physically demanding sometimes, which might add to physiological changes like heart rate elevation, and given your description, especially in combination with an anxiety disorder, this could contribute to triggering a panic-like response. It's important not to immediately attribute all symptoms to anxiety though.\n\nIf you continue experiencing these episodes, I would recommend that you discuss them with your healthcare provider, who may want to order additional tests - such as stress test, echocardiogram etc - to rule out any potential cardiovascular conditions considering the episode happened during strenuous activity. \n\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and balanced diet could also help reduce anxiety symptoms and improve both cardiovascular and overall health. Consider seeking help from a mental health professional to help manage your panic attacks better if they are affecting your quality of life.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Did the patient recently have illnesses or surgeries?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

A platelet count of 1314 is considered high, this condition is known as thrombocytosis. It can be a sign of several conditions which could include:\n\n1. Anemia: This condition may arise due to iron deficiency or due to loss of blood.\n\n2. Inflammations: Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or infections can cause your platelet count to rise.\n\n3. Cancer: Certain types of cancer like lung, stomach, or ovarian cancer increases the production of platelets.\n\n4. Hemolytic anemia: This type of anemia occurs when your body destroys red blood cells before their normal lifespan is over, triggering your bone marrow to produce more blood cells and inadvertently, platelets.\n\n5.

I am 54 years old and my weight is 87 kg. My medications are Metformin 500 mg, Hcl 1500 mg, Istavel 100 mg and Glaritus Insulin 30 units. Even then the sugar levels are 246, 265 and 277 after every three hours today. My creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, T3 and TSH are normal.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHello,\n\nFirstly, I understand and appreciate your concern about your elevated blood sugar levels despite ongoing treatment. As you may know, an HbA1c level of 9.83 suggests that your diabetes is not well controlled over the past three months. Your current blood glucose readings are still quite high, which means further action needs to be taken.\n\nYour medication regimen indicates a combination of oral medications (Metformin, Istavel) and injectable insulin (Glaritus). However, with persistent high blood sugar levels, several possibilities should be considered:\n\n1. Medication Dosage: You might need an adjustment in dosage of your existing medication, or possibly an addition of other classes of diabetic medication to better manage your diabetic status.\n   \n2. Diet & Exercise: Review your diet and ensure it aligns with those recommended for someone managing Type 2 Diabetes. Regular moderate-intensity exercise can also enhance insulin sensitivity and help in management of blood glucose levels.\n    \n3. Insulin Resistance: This is a condition where the body does not respond to insulin leading to build up of glucose in the blood. It might require you to switch types of insulin or take higher doses.\n   \n4. Coexisting illness: Certain medical conditions like infections, thyroid disorders etc., although these seem unlikely since your TSH is normal and there's no mention of any symptoms indicative of infection.\n\n5. Patient Compliance: Ensure you're taking medicines as prescribed. Interrupted or incorrect medication use can affect blood sugar control.\n\n\n\n## Output (b):\nWhat are the symptoms you are experiencing?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Cetirizine is an antihistamine used to relieve allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, itching eyes/nose, and sneezing. It works by blocking a certain natural substance (histamine) that your body makes during an allergic reaction.\n \nOn the other hand, Paracetamol (also known as Acetaminophen) is commonly used to alleviate pain and reduce fever. There is no known significant interaction between these two drugs.

My tongue also develops a white coating, that has to be scrapped of daily. I have attached a photo of the same. What are the likely causes?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your description and without the ability to actually visualize your tongue as pictures cannot be attached here, it sounds like you may have oral thrush (candidiasis), a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of the Candida species. It commonly presents with creamy white or yellow spots or a coating on the tongue and other parts of the mouth. A red border could indicate that the lesions are inflamed. \n\nWhile anyone can develop oral thrush, it's more likely in infants and elders, those with weakened immune systems, people who wear dentures or use inhalers for asthma, and those who have been treated with antibiotics or corticosteroids recently.\n\nHowever, there are other conditions that could cause similar symptoms so it would be best to reach out to a healthcare professional for a definite diagnosis. Other possibilities could include leukoplakia or lichen planus.\n\nPlease note that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation.

I have no fever or other symptoms. Should I be concerned? I had my atlas which was supposedly two degrees off by an atlas orthogonal chiropractor. I originally went in because of my knee and wrist pain then before I knew it, I was having my atlas adjusted by a machine. My last few days I have been miserable and feeling awful. Exhausted, my lymph nodes are so painful on the sides of my neck I have been in bed all day. I just feel this might be related but I do not know.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nWhile it's not common for atlas adjustments to directly cause painful, swollen lymph nodes, there might be an unlikely indirect connection through systemic inflammation or your body responding to perceived injury. However, this intense level of discomfort and pain is concerning and may indicate a more serious issue such as an infection or another medical condition.\n\nLymph node swelling often indicates that your body is fighting against some form of infection or illness, even if you don\u2019t have other symptoms like fever. One possibility could be that the manipulation inadvertently caused some mild tissue damage, leading to local inflammation and reactive lymph nodes.\n\nNevertheless, these are speculations and I'd recommend making an appointment with a healthcare provider ASAP so you can get evaluated and treated appropriately. This needs thorough clinical evaluation to rule out any serious causes. Also monitor yourself closely for new symptoms like fever, weight loss, night sweats, etc.\n  \nIt's also worth noting that future chiropractic interventions should always align with your comfort level and understanding, and should never result in severe discomfort afterwards, so I would engage in a discussion about this incident with your care provider at your earliest opportunity.\n\n## Output (b):\n Did the chiropractor give you any medication for the lymph nodes?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have had a lot of digestive problems for about two years. I have been diagnosed with candida and dysbiosis but my regular doctor does not seem to know what is wrong with me. I have been very stressed and have suffered anxiety since I was about 16. I was not on any medications and started taking Cymbalta a few months ago.After about three to four days, I started to notice a bit of burning in my feet. I have since stopped taking the Cymbalta about a month ago. My feet seemed fine. Then seven days ago, I have started getting really bad pain in my feet and burning and tickling and pins and needle feelings. I am not diabetic or alcoholic. I have no idea what has brought this on or whether it can be reversed. I am so stressed out. I have to be on my feet for my job for about four and a half hours every morning. Can this be tested to see if the nerve cells are either dead or just damaged and can it be reversed? This feels like it is going to ruin my life. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I will try my best to help you. It seems like you may be experiencing peripheral neuropathy, which is often characterized by pain, tingling, and other unusual sensations in the extremities such as feet.\n\nFirst off, it's good that possible causes of peripheral neuropathy such as diabetes and alcoholism have been ruled out. While these are common causes, there are many others including certain medications (indeed, Cymbalta could potentially cause these symptoms), some infections, autoimmune diseases and trauma or pressure on the nerve.\n\nThe burning sensation might be related to your recently stopping Cymbalta, as abrupt cessation can lead to withdrawal effects, one of which includes abnormal sensations like \"pins and needles\". However, these usually resolve over time without treatment.\n\nYour stress and anxiety might also be contributing factors to your condition. Your body's reaction to stress can manifest physically, including exacerbating pain and discomfort.\n\nIn order to clarify things further, it would be beneficial to get a comprehensive health checkup. You should see a neurologist or pain specialist who can perform tests such as an electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction study; these can provide information about the damage to nerves.\n\nTreatment of peripheral neuropathy focuses on treating the underlying cause and providing symptomatic relief. If indeed caused by withdrawing from Cymbalta, symptoms should decrease over time.

The symptoms you're describing could be suggestive of petechiae, which are small, round pin-point spots appearing under the skin that aren't typically raised or itchy. Petechiae happen due to bleeding under the skin and they can occur as a result of certain medical conditions, taking certain medications, injury/trauma, straining (like intense coughing or vomiting), or for reasons unknown.\n\nHowever, diagnosis requires face-to-face consultation with a trained physician. It is very important to see your healthcare provider as soon as possible to examine these spots because they may indicate a serious condition such as low platelet count, blood clotting issues, infections, etc.\n\nPlease remember this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation.

After that, I got some tests done, which resulted in CMV IgG positive. Then I got vaccinated for rubella to prevent any casualties in the next pregnancy. Now I want to try and conceive, but just now I got my torch panel done again. And now the HSV IGM is positive with 1.15 range along with CMV and rubella IgG positive. Should I wait or can I try to conceive right now? My husband\\s torch panel also done, nothing abnormal.I am currently under Folic acid and Multivitamin, for now, to conceive faster. And also a homeopathic medicine for migraine.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nA positive CMV and rubella IgG indicates past infection and confers immunity, which is why vaccination for rubella is provided. The HSV IgM being positive suggests a recent or current herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, it's important to understand that this could be either oral or genital herpes.\n\nBefore you try to conceive, I recommend discussing this with your OB/GYN or an infectious disease specialist as there can potentially be transmission of HSV to the baby during delivery if there are active lesions. Treatment before getting pregnant might reduce the risk.\n\nYour doctor may also consider antiviral treatment or other precautionary measures during your pregnancy to prevent neonatal herpes. But every situation is different because whether herpes poses a threat depends on various factors such as timing of transmission and status of maternal antibodies.\n\nPlease remember that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may vary.

He is 14 months and 1 week old. He has not started to walk by his own but started to crawl since 12 months. Is there a problem with his leg muscle?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, it is important to reassure you that every child develops different skills at their own pace. At 14 months, it's not unusual for some children to have not started walking yet. Generally, most children start walking independently between 9 to 17 months. If your son has already started crawling, that\u2019s a good sign as it indicates he is gaining the strength and balance necessary to eventually move on to walking. \n\nHowever, if you notice any other symptoms such as lack of coordination, weakness, inability to bear weight  on his legs, or general motor skill delays, then it would be worth consulting with a pediatrician. It might also be recommended to check regular milestones like sitting without support, standing with assistance etc. If there are issues in those areas too, you should consult a pediatrician who may recommend a physical therapist.\n\nRemember, each child grows and develops at their own rate, so avoid comparing him to others.\n\n## Output (b):\n Okay, I'm going to need you to answer this question for the doctor.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I do not have any problem with swallowing. Kindly advise me the needful.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHello, it's great news that after taking antibiotics your tonsillitis pain has subsided. However, the feeling of something stuck in your throat might be a residual symptom from the infection, or could be due to another reason such as pharyngitis or even post nasal drip.\n\nFor now, you can try some home remedies like warm salt water gargles and hydration which is particularly good for keeping the mucus moist and thin thereby reducing the sensation of something being 'stuck'.\n\nHowever, if your symptoms persist beyond a week, or if you develop any other symptoms like weight loss, difficulty swallowing, voice changes or prolonged cough, do consult your doctor again since these could indicate conditions with greater severity that demand immediate attention. Do not ignore these signs if they appear. \nThis advice is given based on your described symptoms , but without proper physical examination and relevant investigations, accurate diagnosis cannot be made.\n\n## Output (b):\n Does the pain in your throat worsen when you swallow?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

These small red pimples create a red area when seen from far away because they are very small and inflamed. It never disappears. My skin always feels stuck and not flexible and with a mildly itchy or burning sensation. No matter how much moisturizer I apply, it does not help. I am using Eucerin atopic control moisturizer and a gel cleanser with Hyaluronan. I even tried using Metronidazole and tea oil, but again it did not help. I have also tried to stop using anything on my face for some days, but it stayed the same. I am 24 years old now, and I never had acne tendencies when I was a teenager, and my skin always looked very smooth. My birth control pill is still the same as it was when I first started taking it, which wad around ten years ago. I do not use steroid creams nor fluoride toothpaste. How can I get rid of this? It was not there before a year. I am attaching a picture of my face. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry, but as a artificial intelligence, I can't physically examine you nor view any photos. However, based on your description, it seems like you might be dealing with a skin condition known as rosacea, perioral dermatitis or another similar type of chronic, inflammatory skin problem. These conditions are often associated with the symptoms you mentioned: small pimples that don't clear up, redness, and sensations of itching or burning.\n\nHowever, only a qualified professional healthcare provider can provide an accurate diagnosis. So, book an appointment with your dermatologist to confirm if this is what's causing the problems in your case. There they will enable customized treatment plans which may include oral antibiotics, topical creams, laser treatments, lifestyle changes, etc. \n\nRemember, not all skin disorders respond to over-the-counter products, regardless of how effective those products may be for other people or other types of skin issues. It's best not to self-medicate too much without knowing exactly what the problem is because you might inadvertently worsen the issue. The doctor might need to prescribe you something different than Metronidazole or tea tree oil.\n\nIn the meantime, try gentle cleansing, avoid picking or scratching at the area, and keep out of harsh weather as much as possible. Cold, wind, heat, and sun exposure can sometimes exacerbate these kinds of conditions. Maintaining a comforting and clean environment for your skin could help ease the situation till you visit your dermatologist.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Here is my question: There are five pills left in the blister, and because of your advice I would like to quit right now from taking pills. Is it alright to stop now or should I finish the pills this month and then stop taking them?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIf you already have an intrauterine device (IUD), like Mirena, then typically there's no need to take additional contraceptive pills. The IUD itself is effective in preventing pregnancy.\n\nRegarding your current situation where you have 5 pills remaining and wish to stop taking them due to the presence of the IUD, it should be safe for you to discontinue the pills now. This decision should not decrease the effectiveness of your birth control since you're relying on the Mirena.\n\nHowever, please understand that changes in hormones (due to starting or stopping birth control pills) can potentially lead to some side effects such as mood swings, changes in menstrual bleeding, or temporary changes in skin conditions. \n\nAdditionally, if your baseline body temperature is consistently high and not related to environmental factors, it would be worth checking with your healthcare provider to rule out any underlying causes such as infections, hormonal imbalances or other health issues. Changes in menstrual bleeding could also be due to adjusting to the IUD, but persistently heavy or long-lasting periods should also be evaluated by your healthcare provider.\n\n## Output (b):\n If the patient is not a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I originally felt the pain after playing lots of baseballs (swinging a baseball bat many times). I have symptoms such as tightness, limited mobility or restricted range of motion, throbbing pain, and sometimes it gets so bad that it became hard for me to even walk or sit! I went to my athletic trainer a month ago, and she told me she thinks it is just an aggravated muscle spasm. So she told me to just give it some rest from the activity that hurt it. So I gave it about a month, in which it seemed there was no pain. But as soon as I tried to do the activity that hurt me in the first place, it went right back to hurting. It would be of great help for any assistance. What should I do now?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nFrom your description, it does sound like a muscle strain or spasm related to overuse from playing baseball. The fact that symptoms improved with rest but worsened when you returned to the activity suggests it's directly related to your sporting activities.\n\nHowever, given the severity and duration of your pain, I would advise seeing a healthcare professional for a full evaluation. They may recommend things like physical therapy, muscle relaxants, or exercises and stretches to help strengthen your lower back muscles and improve flexibility.\n\nFurthermore, they can rule out more serious conditions such as a herniated disc, which may present with similar symptoms. It is also advisable to seek instruction on proper form and warm-up exercises before returning to your sport in order to prevent this condition from recurring.\n\nUntil you are able to see a healthcare provider, try to rest, use heat or cold packs, take over-the-counter pain relievers, and avoid any activities that worsen the pain. Gentle stretching and walking can often be beneficial as well.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please help!

She had negative home pregnancy tests, a negative test at the doctor, and had a miscarriage the next day after doctors test. My question is, could it be possible there is another fetus remaining inside? I only ask because we each have one parent that is a twin. Please advise.She thought she was on her period the entire week. Bled for seven days. Sheattributed it to the Plan-b pill she took several weeks back. We hadunprotected sex but I still pulled out. She is on birth control andused a Plan-b pill. How is any of this miscarriage stuffpossible especially after just seeing the doctor the day beforemiscarriage?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nSince both home and doctor's tests revealed a negative outcome, it suggests that the hormone levels which indicate pregnancy (human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG) were not high enough to be detected. It is feasible that your partner miscarried very early in the pregnancy when the hormonal changes are usually not substantial yet\u2014this is known as a chemical pregnancy.\n\nThe bleeding could actually have been the miscarriage itself rather than her period, especially if it was more painful or heavier than usual. Or, the miscarriage may have happened after the bleeding due to other factors.\n\nUsing emergency contraception like Plan-B and regular birth control might not always prevent every single instance of conception. Emergency contraception is most effective within 72 hours after unprotected sex and even then, is not 100% preventive. Similarly, no birth control method is completely foolproof. \n\nAs for another fetus remaining inside, it's quite unlikely given that a negative pregnancy test before the miscarriage would indicate absence of any detectable level of pregnancy hormones. Having one parent each who is a twin does raise the chances of having twins but doesn't guarantee it. Since this wasn't a confirmed pregnancy, it's hard to definitively say whether twins might have been possible.\n\nRegardless, I suggest your partner should see her doctor for follow-up care after her miscarriage to ensure she's recovering well physically and emotionally. Her doctor can undertake further investigations if he/she deems necessary based on her medical history.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n How old is your partner?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have had a couple of speech therapy sessions but progress is glacial. I am still hoarse and in pain. I have been on 40 mg of Omeprazole for a month and Gaviscon Double Action for two weeks. I feel like the back of my throat is still swollen and I have pain in the corners of my throat. This only briefly eases when I really do some throat opening exercises. I cannot talk for very long without everything getting sore still. I have been like this since the beginning of the year since I had a chest infection and pneumonia. My mouth is now getting sore from all the Gaviscon tablets as the liquid irritates the corners of my throat. I really do not know what else I can do. I am having panic attacks and starting to feel like the only option is to take my life. I had a post nasal drip for most of the year so far and I am trying to get my salivary glands to work again properly.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need.

It just got worse. I play soccer and that and the sweat is what was irritating it. So I finally went to the doctor and they prescribed me SMZ, TMP DS. I took it for about a week until I realized I was having a lot of side effects and an allergic reaction especially around my mouth. At first I thought I was just breaking out. Then it was not like sores or blisters. I kept self-treating the rash around my mouth and stopped taking the antibiotics. For a couple days it was gone. I was happy. Then I was in the sun one day for soccer and it was just like another rash but worse. I stayed home from school, did not do anything because I just wanted to get it better. But now it looks really bad. I believe I have perioral dermatitis. It is red patches all around my mouth. It is really dry and scaly, also there are like white-heads around my mouth also but they are not whiteheads. I would try to moisturize it with coconut oil or tea tree oil but I think that is what made it worse.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like you're going through a tough time with your skin. You haven't specified the cause or source of your initial secondary burn, which could be important as it may still be affecting your healing process. Sulfa-medications (like SMZ/TMP DS) can unfortunately cause hypersensitivity reactions in some people, including rash and photosensitivity (i.e., sensitivity to sunlight).\n\nThe presentation you describe around your mouth could indeed be perioral dermatitis, characterized by red, scaly patches and tiny bumps or \"pustules\" aka whiteheads. However, keep in mind other possibilities too such as an allergic contact dermatitis - maybe from ingredients in lip products or toothpaste.\n\nMoisturizing is important but choose products wisely \u2013 many natural oils, like coconut oil or tea tree oil, can actually irritate or worsen certain conditions. In general, opt for hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic (won't clog pores), fragrance-free options when possible. \n\nSince over-the-counter self-treatment hasn't been successful, it might be best to revisit a healthcare provider. A dermatologist would be ideal, if obtainable. Your condition warrants an examination and possibly testing for a more precise diagnosis, followed by guided treatment. This could include topical creams or gels, oral medications, or others depending on the specific diagnosis.\n\n## Output (b):\n Does the patient have any of the following symptoms?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Could you also tell me by perhaps drawing on the shot what waves and shapes indicate problems?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to view attachments, images or provide hands-on assistance. However, I can help explain what doctors generally look for on a treadmill stress test and some conditions it may reveal.\n\nOn a treadmill stress test (also known as exercise ECG or Exercise Stress Test), physicians monitor:\n\n1. Heart rate response: Normally, heart rate increases with progressive exercise.\n2. Blood pressure response: Healthy blood pressure tends to rise during exertion but should not exceed certain values.\n3. Presence of chest pain or other suggestive symptoms.\n4. Physical performance: How someone manages the demands of increasing physical stress is also part of such a test.\n5. Electrocardiogram changes: Ischemia caused by coronary artery disease can result in specific changes in the electrocardiograph, including ST segment depression/elevation or T wave inversion.\n  \nIf your report mentions an infarction, it might be due to the presence of significant Q waves which are indicators of previous myocardial infarctions (\"heart attacks\"). The location of these waves can suggest the area of the heart affected and the possible artery involved. The severity and timing of an infarction cannot typically be determined precisely from a stress test alone; however, the presence of significant Q waves often indicates serious past damage.\n\nA machine error is unlikely if proper procedures were followed, though results should always be interpreted alongside clinical symptoms and further corroborated by diagnostic tools like imaging studies\n\n## Output (b):\n The report indicates that there is an infarction on the left ventricle and that a stress test was performed.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

High levels of TSH could possibly indicate that you have a condition called hypothyroidism, where your thyroid gland does not produce adequate amounts of thyroid hormones.

It has been there a good few months now and the area is swollen. Is this cancer?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I can't make a definitive diagnosis online without examining you personally. However, your symptoms could be attributed to several conditions. While rare cases of tonsil cancer do exist, it is more common that these kind of issues are due to tonsillitis or tonsil stones, which can cause similar symptoms - lumps, swelling and discomfort in the throat area.\n\nTonsil stones are small deposits of food particles, mucus, and bacteria that get trapped in the tonsils' pocket and harden over time. They're usually harmless but can produce unpleasant symptoms.\n\nHowever, If the lump doesn\u2019t go away, it increases in size, or you have other symptoms like unexplained weight loss, difficulty swallowing, bleeding or persistent pain, you should consult with healthcare provider promptly for better evaluation. A physical examination or further tests may be needed to confirm what these symptoms are related to.

All her life she thought she had a problem with her heart but she went to see a doctor and he said she is in perfect health. She starts shaking and cannot breathe and I am really scared and try to calm her down but she cannot breathe. She cannot stop shaking for at least half an hour. I do not know what to do and I hope you can tell me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear about the severity of your friend's panic attacks and anxiety. These conditions can indeed resemble certain heart problems, which is why people often get confused and scared.\n\nReassure your friend that although panic attacks are remarkably intense and frightening, they're not harmful by themselves. Seek professional help for her - a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders.\n\nIn the mean time, there are several things you can do if she's experiencing a panic attack:\n\n1) Help your friend to conduct \"four square\" breathing: Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold the breath for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, and remain empty for 4 seconds before repeating again. This practice helps to calm the body and reduce physical symptoms of a panic attack.\n\n2) Encourage her to stay grounded in the present moment by asking her to describe what she sees, hears, and feels around her.\n\n3) Encourage progressive muscle relaxation: Help her relax all of the muscles in her body, one at a time. Start from toes moving up through the legs, trunk, arms and finally the face.\n\nBut most importantly, professional help should be sought. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been shown to be very effective in treating panic disorders and anxiety. Medications like benzodiazepines or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might also be considered as per physician's advice.\n\nEncourage her to avoid caffeine, alcohol, smoking and recreational drugs,\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the patient's age?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Recently, I have elevated AST levels. There is no hepatitis or inflammatory diseases, alcohol, drug use, or fatty liver, or Addison\\s.Liver biopsy showed inflammation, but a resolving process likely attributed to a year long Lyme disease treatment with various pharmaceuticals but discontinued two years ago. Liver enzymes dropped to 50 ALT, but have recently elevated to 130 ALT.At this point, there is no known cause. I was told to continue to wait and see. I would like to take a different approach and determine if there is something my hepatologist is not seeing. The current medications are Lamictal and Gabapentin, Trazodone. I had abdominal CT, abdominal MRI, liver biopsy, ultrasounds, and a significant amount of blood work.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe elevation of both the ALT and AST levels indicate some form of liver injury or inflammation. It's good that you've had so many tests done to rule out most of the common causes like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, alcohol use, etc. However, it can sometimes be difficult to identify a clear cause in cases like this.\n\nOne possibility could be your medications - Gabapentin, Trazodone, and especially Lamictal, which are known to potentially affect the liver in rare instances. \n\nOverexertion and intense physical exercise is another recent finding that might cause elevation in these enzymes.\n\nAutoimmune hepatitis is another possible diagnosis that should be considered. It is an immune system condition where the body attacks its own liver cells causing inflammation and at the same time increases enzymes like ALT, AST. \n\nI suggest discussing these possibilities with your hepatologist. You may need additional testing such as a repeat liver biopsy, autoimmune or genetic markers studies (like for Wilson's disease or hemochromatosis) if not already done.\n\nIt would also be beneficial to talk about possibly switching one or more of your current drugs under careful supervision to see if this improves your liver enzyme levels.

I consulted a doctor a long time ago. The doctor told me that it is normal. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nWhile I'm an AI, my programming is based on medical knowledge so I can provide advice regarding this issue. Small pimple-like bumps on the penis or testicles can be caused by many things including: \n\n1. Pearly penile papules: Small domed-shaped or thread-like skin-colored pimples that are very common and completely harmless. They typically show up on the ridge of the glans (the 'head' of the penis).\n   \n2. Fordyce spots: These are tiny white or yellowish spots, found on the head or the shaft of the penis or in the scrotum. They're sebaceous glands (glands that produce sebum) that have no hair follicle and because of that, they appear as small spots. They are also completely normal and harmless.\n   \n3.

All were negative. The antibody test I took is not a fourth generation test. Is it conclusive or should I take another test? If I repeat the HIV test after six months what is the chance of staying negative? I am facing the problem like small bumps in the tongue, from the last two days a little bit of pain below ear region and it is a little swollen. Is it due to HIV? I am stressed, scared, full of tension. These are hampering my life. I do not know what to do. Today I am in the 107th day of exposure.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on the HIV tests you've had done so far, it seems as though you are HIV negative. Typically, a test taken 3 months after exposure is considered conclusive. The ELISA antibody tests and the HIV proviral DNA PCR tests that you've had done are reliable at detecting the virus in your body.\n \nHIV may cause a variety of symptoms, however, most commonly these can include fever, sore throat, fatigue - signs that are often confused with a flu-like illness. What you're describing with bumps on your tongue and swelling/pain near your ear may be unrelated to an HIV infection, perhaps some other infection or inflammation. Of course, without further examination, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer.\n\nAs for repeating the HIV test 6 months post-exposure, under rare circumstances where the immune system takes longer to produce detectable antibodies, testing negative after six months would likely rule out HIV infection entirely. However, this level of delay in seroconversion is not common. \n\nRegardless, I recommend trying to stay calm and seeking medical attention for your current symptoms. Persistent anxiety over potential HIV infection despite multiple negative tests might mean that speaking with a mental health provider could be beneficial for you too. It's important to remember that although the virus can be life-changing, HIV is now considered a chronic but manageable disease, thanks largely to advances in antiretroviral therapy. Regular use of condoms provides excellent protection against transmission.\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your question.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have never really taken them off. I would sleep with the contact lenses in my eyes and I have started wearing them since I was 13 years old. I would change them, but I would not take them off, and I would go days. My vision gets worse when I go to the eye doctor, but I have not had problems with infections. Recently I noticed that my left eye is red without pain or irritation, but red as the color of the pink eye. I do not know if it is the contact lenses which is causing the redness. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nSleeping with contact lenses on can lead to a number of problems, including but not limited to an increase in infections, corneal neovascularization (new blood vessels growing into the clear part of the eye), and changes in your cornea that may permanently affect your vision. That being said, it's impossible for me to diagnose exactly why your eye is red without an examination. The lack of pain or irritation is a good sign, but persistent redness can indicate a problem like inflammation or an infection, even if you've never had an infection before.\n\nYou absolutely must remove your contacts and stop wearing them immediately until you see your doctor. If the redness subsolves after removing the lens, then it was most likely due to the contact lens - perhaps hypoxia (lack of oxygen) to your cornea, since constant contact use does not allow enough oxygen to reach the cornea. But if redness continues or gets worse, this could be an emergency situation such as a corneal ulcer. Please seek immediate medical attention from an ophthalmologist promptly when symptoms persist.\n  \nPlease remember to follow proper contact lens hygiene moving forward: do not sleep in your lenses unless they are specifically designed for extended wear, always cleanse them properly, replace as recommended by your eye care provider, and take breaks from wearing them when possible.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I was doing it too fast, and at one point, I got a sharp pain in my back, near where my ribs meet my spine. Since then, I am also having very sharp pain when inhaling and exhaling, as well as when rotating my torso or neck. Should I need to go for urgent care? Currently, I am taking Zyrtec, Amino acid supplements for energy and muscle recovery, hormonal IUD.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nWhat you're describing may be an injured muscle or rib, possibly a strain or even a tear. Exhaling and inhaling causes movement in the torso which can further irritate a strained muscle. It's important that you get this pain checked out to rule out anything more serious since your symptoms involve respiratory discomfort.\n\nThe medications and supplements you mentioned do not interfere with this situation specifically but it might help your healthcare provider make decisions on what medications they can provide you for possible therapy. \n\nYes, I'd recommend seeking urgent medical attention especially because of sharp chest pain and difficulty breathing. Even though it seems like this occurred due to excessive workout, it is highly crucial to rule out any other critical health issues such as pleurisy (inflammation of tissues that line the lungs and chest cavity), lung conditions, heart problems and others.\n\nPlease remember, although it's vital to exercise, its pertinent we follow our body's cues to prevent injuries. Always remember warm ups and cool downs are essential before intense sessions and increasing intensity gradually helps our body adapt better preventing any sudden shocks.

I have seen my period in the second month of last year and miss it up for a further two months. I have seen it again after three months and stopped at the end of that month. But anytime I have sexual intercourse, I will bleed and past lots of blood clots for at least three days and then stop, and I waited for four days.

It sounds like your menstrual cycle is irregular and there's abnormal bleeding after intercourse, both of which could have several potential underlying causes, including hormonal imbalances (like PCOS), infections, fibroids, endometriosis or more serious conditions such as cervical or uterine cancer.\n\nIt's essential to seek immediate medical attention. You should discuss your history and symptoms with a healthcare professional who can guide you on the next steps.

The last week I have had constant headaches and periodic blurry vision. I am wondering if this could be a result of not wearing my glasses. How often should I be wearing my glasses? The periodic blurry vision started two weeks ago and one week ago the constant headache started (4 to 6 out of 10). I have seen a few different doctors about it but they are not sure.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour prescription indicates that you have astigmatism and myopia (short-sightedness), which means your eye can't focus light properly onto the retina. When you don\u2019t wear your glasses, your eyes will strain to try to get a clear image. This additional effort your eyes make can cause headaches as well as blurry vision.\n\nSo, yes, your symptoms could indeed be due to not wearing your glasses. Generally, if glasses are prescribed for full-time use, they should be worn throughout the day, especially during tasks that require clear distance vision like driving or watching television.\n\nHowever, it is also important to consider other possible causes of your symptoms such as migraines, stress, high blood pressure, eye strain from excessive screen time, or some underlying systemic conditions. I would recommend returning to the ophthalmologist for a comprehensive recheck. If everything turns out fine on the eye exam then perhaps explore other possibilities with your primary care doctor. \n\nIn the meantime, please start using your eyeglasses consistently.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is it true that you experience headaches, constant?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

This can cause damage to the surrounding tissues as well and explain the bleeding. \n\nI suggest you immediately go to the emergency department since this could potentially be serious. Dental injuries often require immediate attention and if left untreated can lead to severe complications such as an infection or permanent damage.\n\nPainkillers can aid in managing the pain but avoid taking Aspirin right now as it might increase the bleeding. Try not to touch or agitate the area more than necessary. Consider rinsing your mouth with a warm salt water solution (half a teaspoon of salt dissolved in 8 ounces of warm water) \u2013 this will help keep your mouth clean. Until you get professional care, try to keep the tooth in its original place by applying gentle pressure. \n\nFinding immediate professional treatment is crucially important when experiencing any sort of dental trauma so I would strongly recommend seeing a dentist or visiting Emergency Department ASAP.\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the patient's name?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

So, I want to know what is happeing with me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThese symptoms could possibly point to a few conditions, such as peptic ulcers or gastritis. These conditions can cause pain in your upper abdomen that's usually felt more on an empty stomach. The warm and itchy feeling around the belly button isn't typical for this type of conditions but can be part of your personal symptomatology.

I have no cut on lips and mouth. Is there any chance of me getting any STI?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) from kissing is generally low. Most STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, are primarily transmitted through sexual activity, not kissing. However, certain infections, such as herpes or oral HPV can be spread through skin-to-skin contact, which includes kissing.\n\nAs for the breasts, most STIs aren't passed on this way unless there were visible sores on her skin that came into direct contact with your mouth and you had open sores or cuts on your lips or in your mouth, the chance of transmission is quite low.\n \nNevertheless, it's important to remember that some infections may not show symptoms right away, or at all. Regular testing is key to detecting and treating them early. If you feel anxious about the incident, get tested to put your mind at ease. \n\nIn future, always practice safe interactions to further decrease risk.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you a doctor?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am 5\\7\" in height and140 lbs weight. My dad is 5\\9, and my mom is 5\\1. I would like to at least reach 5\\9 to 5\\10. My diet is exceptional. I am taking a multivitamin, and I do not have any deficiencies. I am thinking of taking 1500 mg of Glucosamine because I read studies concluding that it may help a bit. Would you recommend glucosamine, or something else?Also, do you think I can still reach my height goal? I am worried that I may have stunted my growth. I have had insomnia, depression, and anxiety for four years now. This has affected my life considerably, and I am worried I would not grow to my potential height because of it. I also have not been getting too much calcium and protein because I have been avoiding dairy products. Should I be drinking more milk and if so, how much?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, it's important to note that individual growth and height are influenced by several factors - the most significant being your genetics. With parents of 5'1\" and 5'9\", as an average you can anticipate reaching somewhere around the mid-range given your current height at age 17. \n\nWhile certain studies point towards potential benefits of glucosamine for cartilage health, it is not directly correlated with increasing growth in humans and I would advise against using it purely for that purpose.\n\nConsidering your insomnia, anxiety, and depression, these conditions could potentially impact your physical health, including stunting growth if they caused significant malnutrition or distress during critical growth periods.

My back gets locked when I am standing still. There is too much pain on the right side while sitting on a hard surface. There is also nerve pain after having food sitting on the ground. There is pain only on the right side while using the commode. I am suffering from this pain from the past two years and have not got any relief. Kindly help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms of back pain, particularly on one side, that worsens with certain movements or positions and seems to involve some nerve involvement is suggestive of conditions like sciatica, muscle strain, herniated disc, or possibly a more serious condition like spinal stenosis. However, diagnosing any medical condition requires a detailed clinical examination and often further diagnostic tests.\n\nYou'll need an evaluation from a physician who may consider X-rays, MRI, CT scan or other imaging studies for proper diagnosis. Consultation with a physical therapist might also provide additional insight and possible treatment options for managing your pain.\n\nIt's crucial to mention that persistent pain deserves professional medical attention - so if you haven't done so already, please see a healthcare provider in person as soon as possible.\n\n\nThese recs are for information purposes only.

I move my pupil left to right and see a bright arc of light. I cannot make it stay there, it just flashes as I move my eye balls left to right. Any ideas?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe symptoms you're describing could be related to a condition called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) where the back part of the vitreous, a jelly-like substance in your eye, pulls away from the retina. This often happens naturally as we age.\n\nHowever, it could also be an indication of more serious conditions like a retinal tear or detachment which requires immediate medical attention. These are rather rare but should not be neglected if they occur.\n\nPlease get your eyes examined immediately by an ophthalmologist and describe the symptoms carefully to them.

I am 173 cm. My mother is 173 cm and father is 189 cm. I had a blood test to determine my HGH levels. The doctor asked me for a testosterone and GH test. The result came back a week later and it said that I had a low HGH level and a 21/42 level testosterone. Is this normal for an 18 year old male? I was devastated that my growth plates were closed, because I also had an x-ray of left hand. My doctor asked me whether I am sexually active. I answered him no. But, I got a doubt regarding erectile dysfunction. Am I suffering from erectile dysfunction? Should I be worried? Is my testosterone too low? How can I increase testosterone? I had torsion three years back and nothing back happened. But, this could be a factor. Another factor may be that I used to hold my mobile phone in my pocket all the time.I am a sprint athlete and have defined leg muscles, but this could be due to my short stature. I have gone for another blood test for GH, just as a follow up and that time I was advised to fast for 14 hours. But, I did not fast during my first blood test. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your information, you seem to have multiple concerns related to growth, testosterone levels, possible erectile dysfunction, and the influence of a past torsional injury.\n\nYour height is influenced not just by your parents' heights but also other factors including nutrition and health during childhood. Your height appears within normal limits and it may not increase further as the bones in your hand have already closed, suggesting overall skeletal maturity.\n\nTestosterone levels could vary with time of day, so interpretation depends on when it was measured and what kind of test was used. The 21/42 level you mentioned isn't well-defined (since units are missing), so it's difficult to know its exact implications. However, generally speaking, low Testosterone can lead to less body hair, more body fat, smaller muscles, lower sex drive and problems getting erections.\n\nErectile dysfunction means difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection that's sufficient for sexual activity. If you're experiencing such issues, then yes, you might be dealing with ED. But if you did not mention this issue to your doctor, he perhaps asked about your sexual activity to understand if you have any secondary sexual characteristics, which are an indirect measure of sex hormones like testosterone.\n\nTo improve testosterone levels, maintain a healthy lifestyle - balanced diet, regular exercise, enough sleep, and minimal stress. Also, overweight and some medication may affect testosterone levels\u2014it needs further investigation in case you do fall under these categories.\n\nTorsion shouldn\u2019t have long-term impacts unless it led to\n\n## Output (b):\n What is your age?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I feel that I am recovering normally from what I was told and what I read. However, the area immediately above my belly button is extremely sore and appears to almost be bulging and is slightly elevated when touched. I did have my follow up and questioned this area and he cited the muscle repair and the liposuction but I wanted to get a second opinion on this and see if anyone has had similar experiences that are normal.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I would suggest that discomfort and swelling near the area of surgery is indeed very common after abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) combined with liposuction. Both the muscle repair and liposuction could cause these effects in the post-operative period. \n\nHowever, the phrase 'bulging' and mention of it being 'slightly elevated' when touched may potentially indicate serum or hematoma formation (collection of fluid/blood), especially if it feels like a fluid-filled balloon under your skin. This might happen after any type of body contouring or plastic surgery procedures to some extent and can be managed appropriately by your surgeon.\n\nWhile this could still be within the range of normalcy for the recovery process, you should definitely keep an open line of communication with your primary surgeon who knows your situation best. Consider getting a follow-up appointment sooner rather than later, since physical examinations are crucial in such situations and much more informative than online consultations. If it becomes significantly painful, or you develop fever, redness around the area, nausea or vomiting, then seek immediate medical care as these could potentially be signs of infection or other complications.

I usually ace my tests because I have a very short term memory, so cramming often makes do. But, I often tend to forget things when my body takes the so-called auto-pilot mode. During these times, I tend to do things with me, not really focusing on doing it because I was thinking of something else. I cannot really recall what exactly happened in a day when nothing special has occurred. I often forget where I put things, even when they are already in front of me, or in my hand. I seem to misplace habitually and it has pertrubed my parents. Now I am wandering if these are early symptoms of Alzheimer\\s. Please reply, and if you want to ask questions about me,feel free.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's understandable that you're concerned, but it's essential to remember that although Alzheimer's disease can start early in rare cases, it typically occurs in people over the age of 65. More likely, based on your age and symptoms, is some form of attention deficit or even a mild cognitive impairment. Sometimes these experiences might be tied with stress or overwhelming situations.\n\nThe symptoms you are describing (forgetfulness, 'auto-pilot mode,' misplacing items) could be indicators of a variety of things. They may be a sign of ADHD, particularly since they have been present since childhood. Another feasible explanation would be symptoms related to anxiety or depression which often manifests as concentration problems leading to forgetfulness. \n\nNevertheless, in order to accurately diagnose your condition, it's crucial for you to schedule an appointment with a professional healthcare provider. Initially, I will recommend a consult with a primary care physician who can do initial assessment and then refer to a specialist if required. This generally involves a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and possibly imaging studies to rule out any other issues that could be causing your symptoms. Differentiating between all these conditions needs a thorough evaluation, so please don't hesitate to seek help!\n\n## Output (b):\n Excuse me, doctor, there are some questions that we need to ask about the patient's health history.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I think she also has rheumatoid arthritis. For the past five years, she was managing the pain with anti-inflammatory medicine, Lyrica, Mythycobal, Voltaren injections, herbal creams, etc. You can see the veins in her hands popping out. I also realized that the pain has got worse now.For about 12 months the doctor put her only on Prednisolone 5 mg/day and painkiller when necessary. She was fine till last month but the pain increased in her hands now. In the daytime she is fine and the pain starts mildly in the evening. When she lies down in the bed she gets electrical tingling in her legs by which her sleep gets disturbed. She has undergone several tests last week and I attached them for your reference. She did not consult a rheumatologist yet. What medication can I give to reduce the inflammation and cure her? Her ESR, CPR, and ANA are quite high. The pain in her hands and the tingling in her legs at night are agonizing her life. Kindly provide your expert advice.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have access to blood tests or imaging results but based on the symptoms you described for your mother, it does sound like her rheumatological condition is escalating. I suggest the following steps:\n\n1. Referral to a Rheumatologist: This specialist will be able to make a definitive diagnosis of whether your mother has Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in addition to fibromyalgia and can guide medication management accordingly. They might need further testing such as RF( Rheumatoid factor) and Anti-CCP test and assess joints status by physical examination.\n\n2. Medications: It's important that she continues with prescribed medications until she meets a specialist. Short term increase of Prednisolone might be advised if Pain felt uncontrolled but consulting with doctor is necessary before modifying any dosages.\n  \n3. Physiotherapy: A good physiotherapy program could help maintain joint mobility and function.\n\n4. Healthy Lifestyle: Ensure a balanced diet and mild activity daily, this will aid overall health which indirectly contributes to getting relief from symptoms. Try to include some anti-inflammatory foods in her diet like fish & other seafood, fruits, vegetables, nuts and olive oil.\n\n5. Sleep Hygiene: The sensations disturbing her sleep could be due to restless legs syndrome or peripheral neuropathy, both of which are common in RA and fibromyalgia. These issues can also be addressed by a Rheumatologist or Neurologist.\n\nIt\n\n## Output (b):\n What medication does your mother currently take?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am currently applying Benzoyl peroxide gel on my acne. It only reduces the inflammation but bumps are not reducing. I also have pigmentation caused by acne before. I only get acne on my cheeks. What may be the reason? I usually get cyst acne bumps on my cheeks. If acne clears, then it comes again. I have red pigmentation caused by acne. Can you recommend a product for acne and after acne has cleared, can you suggest a product for pigmentation? Can you recommend a product for controlling further breakouts? Also, I wanted to know which sunscreen and moisturizer to use?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe exact cause of acne may vary and can be influenced by various factors like hormones, bacteria on the skin, excess oil production, inflammation etc. In your case, it could be possible that hormonal fluctuations or oil overproduction is causing acne to occur predominantly on your cheeks.\n\nThe benzoyl peroxide gel you are using generally works well to reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that contribute to acne development. However, it might not be effective for everyone, particularly if you have cystic acne, which tends to be more stubborn.\n\nA topical retinoid, such as adapalene (which can be known commercially as Differin) may be more beneficial. Adapalene works by promoting cell turnover, unclogging pores, and reducing inflammation.\n\nFor pigmentation, I would suggest using a product with niacinamide and vitamin C. The former works to even skin tone and reduce post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation while the latter encourages collagen production and helps to lighten dark spots. However, bear in mind these products should be used consistently for at least couple of months to see meaningful results.\n\nPreventing further breakouts will involve regular exfoliation and cleansing. Salicylic acid is a great ingredient for this; it penetrates into the pores and dissolves debris that can cause acne. A combination of salicylic acid cleanser followed by benzoyl peroxide treatment and a non-comedogenic moisturiser might work well.\n\nAs for sunscreen, it's very important to use sunscreen every day when you\n\n## Output (b):\n Why did you get Pimple?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am currently getting labs done for hepatitis B Surf Ab Quant, HBsAg screen, hepatitis B virus profile, and panel. I am getting conflicting information on websites and from healthcare professionals that hepatitis B does not ever leave the body but I also read that 98 % of the people who get it cleared the disease from the body. My question is what is the real answer, can I beat the virus and remove it from my body completely leaving only anti-bodies?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHepatitis B is a complex disease and the outcome of an infection can depend on many factors, such as the patient's age at infection, the state of the immune system and overall health. \n\nIn general, adults who get hepatitis B have about a 95-98% chance of fully recovering and clearing the virus from their body after several months. In these cases, the \"surface antigen\" \u2013 which indicates active viral replication \u2013 becomes negative and hepatitis B surface antibodies (HBsAb) may become positive, indicating immunity against the virus.\n\nHowever, in some people (around 2-5%), the illness becomes chronic. This means they are unable to clear the virus completely and it remains in the body, potentially causing ongoing liver damage. People with chronic Hepatitis B remain infectious and may require lifelong treatment. The presence of the hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) implicates exposure to the virus, but does not distinguish between current or past infections.\n\nYou mention that your Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test was negative (which is good, providing confirmation that you do not have an active infection right now), however, your hepatitis B core antibody test was positive showing that you indeed had been exposed to the virus at some point in time - either cleared up on its own, or if acute/chronic symptoms were experienced, was treated for by a healthcare professional.\n\nYour further testing should help clarify your status.

I do not know what it is? Tonsils are not inflamed, throat a bit dry, and does not hurt to swallow.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your description, it could be a simple condition like dry throat or post-nasal drip (when excess mucus drips down the back of the throat), which can often give the sensation of something stuck in the throat. Sometimes acid reflux, or GERD, can also cause this sensation. Psychological stress at times manifests as a lump or foreign body sensation in the throat - this is known as Globus Sensation. \n\nHowever, persistent symptoms warrant further investigation to rule out other conditions like infections or conditions involving the esophagus, even some rare tumors. \n\nTherefore, although the possibility of serious problems are relatively low based on your current description, it's still recommended that you consult with an Ear-Nose-Throat specialist in-person for a thorough evaluation.

I bought it but for some reason, it does not come with usage instructions. How do I use this product but combining it with SPF 30? I would like to know how to use it for a fresh surgical scar. Can someone please tell me how to use it with SPF 30, that is how to combine SPF 30 for a surgical scar because Contractubex does not come with instructions on how to use it mixing it with SPF 30. I had surgery on right cheek to remove the black birthmark.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nContractubex is widely used to treat scars after surgical operations. Here are the general instructions on how to use it:\n\n1. Cleanse and dry the scarred area before you apply Contractubex.\n\n2. Apply a thin layer of Contractubex onto the scar gently without rubbing.\n\n3. Ideally for fresh scars, It should be applied 2-3 times daily for at least 3 months for better results. \n\nRemember, Contractubex will take time to reduce the scarring process so don't expect instant results.\n\nTo combine it with SPF 30:\n\n1. After applying Contractubex, let your skin absorb the gel completely. \n   \n2. Then, apply SPF 30 sunscreen over the top once the Contractubex has fully dried. Using sunscreen will prevent any potential darkening or discoloration from sun exposure which can often make scars more noticeable.\n\nHowever, communication with your plastic surgeon or dermatologist would be beneficial as they know more about your specific case than anyone could online. Follow up with them and ask when starting to use products like these. Your health care professional's advice would always supersede any information you find here or anywhere else.\n  \nTake note that Contractubex might not be recommended for use in open wounds until they have completely healed. Be cautious about using it too soon post-surgery as this may hinder the healing process.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of about your medical history?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear you're in such discomfort.

Apply ice to the painful area for 15 minutes every hour this evening and apply heat tomorrow alternating with 15 min breaks. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen may help with inflammation and pain as well.\n\nTry not to move your neck excessively or perform activities that cause pain.

My sickness started with a slight fever Tuesday night, then Wednesday I got a higher temperature of 38.1. Then Thursday night rashes appeared. I went to a local doctor Friday morning as my fever reach 39 degrees C. They gave me a fast drip to lower my temperature. Then Saturday morning my temperature went down to 37 but I still have few rashes. Then I started feeling my swollen joint, hands, and feet pain. Now I already took a bath as my temperature is 36.3 C. I am just worried about my swollen feet and hands and the pain is troubling.I am currently takin Biogesic Paracetamol.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms of fever, rash, and joint swelling/pain could be indicative of several conditions such as viral infections like dengue or chikungunya. It's good that your temperature is normalized now, but the persisting rashes and joint pain should not be ignored.\n\nInfections often result in an immune response that can include swollen lymph nodes and painful, swollen joints. Furthermore, some medications can lead to skin rashes and joint pains as side effects.\n\nHowever, it doesn't sound typical for Paracetamol (Biogesic) to cause these kinds of side effects. Considering it's Sunday and you started with a fever Tuesday night, your symptoms have been present for almost a week - which is concerning.\n\nIt would be ideal for more advanced testing. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist, allergist, or rheumatologist may be beneficial depending on what turns up in initial screenings.\nPlease make sure to call ahead to get advice about how to proceed, they might instruct you differently due to the Covid pandemic.\n\nStay hydrated and continue taking the prescribed paracetamol if it helps. Seek medical attention immediately if symptoms worsen. Please keep in mind this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation.

Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the capacity to review imaging studies such as MRIs or diagnostic reports. It would be best if you consulted with your healthcare provider for a thorough examination and interpretation of your MRI results. They will be able to compare your symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and exact findings from your MRI to provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nRegarding your plantar fasciitis: If conservative treatments like rest, physical therapy, orthotics, and cortisone injections aren't successful, other procedures can be considered, such as shock wave therapy, Tenex procedure, or even surgery in severe cases.\n\nLevoxyl is typically used for hypothyroidism, whereas Paxil is commonly prescribed for conditions like anxiety and depression.

I am a vegetarian. I pursue an active lifestyle. I do not smoke or drink. I am a long distance endurance marathon runner. I also strength train three days a week and run two days a week. I got my sugar test, thyroid profile and vitamin D levels checked yesterday. I am attaching the detailed reports, summary as follows:Blood Glucose (F) 89 mg/dL.Blood Glucose (PP) 102 mg/dL.Urine sugar (both in F and PP) not present.HbA1C 5.8 %.Thyroid profile: T3(CLIA) 57 ng/mL, T4(FPIA) 6.38 ug/dL, TSH(CLIA) 1.81 uIU/mL.Vitamin D (25 hydroxycholecalciferol) 26.97 ng/mL.From the reference ranges, things seem to be fine. I just wanted to check with you for any precautions or preventive measures to be taken. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHi there. Based on the results you've provided, everything does indeed appear to be within normal ranges.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1) Your blood glucose levels (both fasting and postprandial), as well as your HbA1C, are all in a healthy range, indicating good glycemic control.\n\n2) Thyroid profile: All the values of T3, T4 and TSH are within reference ranges showing that your thyroid function is normal.\n\n3) Vitamin D: Your total 25(OH)D level is slightly towards the lower end of sufficient category (20-50 ng/mL). Though it suggests you have enough vitamin D to meet most of your body's needs, aiming for a value closer to the middle of the reference range may provide additional benefits.\n\nHere are some general preventive measures and recommendations:\n\n1) Maintain your active lifestyle and balanced nutrition. This alone goes a long way in disease prevention.\n\n2) Given that you're a vegetarian, ensure that your diet includes good sources of iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids, which can sometimes be more challenging to get in adequate amounts from plant-based foods.\n\n3) Although your vitamin D level is considered satisfactory, you might want to consider small amounts of supplementation or simply more sun exposure if practical - just remember to balance this with skin cancer precautions\n\n4) Go for regular check-ups at least once a year to see if there are any changes in health markers.\n\n5)\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for the question.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

She has been constantly relying on anti-hypertensive drugs from the past five years and the situation is aggravating day by day. Moreover, she claims of facing high pulse rate and is positively confirmed by ECG. Currently, she consumes a combination of Cilnidipine and Metoprolol and also other allied drugs in an emergency.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear that your mother is having difficulties with her blood pressure. Given the recurrent nocturnal high blood pressure and increased heart rate, we should consider either dosage adjustment, a different class of antihypertensive drugs, or an additional medication. However, it's not appropriate for me to make full medication management decisions. \n\nIt's essential she has regular reviews with her primary care physician or cardiologist. They're best placed to assess whether changes to her treatment plan are necessary considering her all other medical conditions and mediations (including any non-prescription medications and supplements).\n\nAlso, lifestyle modifications such as reducing sodium intake, maintaining a healthy weight, moderating alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, and following a healthy diet can greatly assist in controlling blood pressure.\n\nLowering stress levels through relaxation techniques might help with high pulse rate. If these measures don't completely control her symptoms, then further investigations may be needed, including possible 24-hour ambulatory Blood pressure monitoring or sleep studies to exclude conditions like nighttime asthma, sleep apnea or other sleep disorders which can affect BP during the night. \n\nGenerally, dose adjustments or prescription changes have to be done under careful professional supervision. It is vital she never stops taking medication without first consulting with her healthcare provider due to risk of rebound high blood pressure or other complex issues. Regular follow-up visits and strong coordination with her primary care doctor will ensure she receives optimal care.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

After the first time, there was a lot of pain, but had a regular whitish discharge. Second time, I started having this brownish or yellowish discharge and I have taken the photo of the discharge. I am not sure what it is? Neither of us have STDs. I am quite scared of being pregnant. I do not remember when I had my last period. Is this discharge normal? Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nWithout examining you in person or being able to see the photographs, I can't provide a definitive diagnosis, but I can share that some changes in vaginal discharge are normal depending on where you are in your menstrual cycle. Regular white or clear vaginal discharge (leukorrhea) is usually healthy. However, a brownish or yellowish discharge could indicate various conditions such as bacterial vaginosis, yeast infection, or sexually transmitted infections. \n\nIt's important to note that having unprotected sex always carries the risk of pregnancy if it occurs during your fertile days. As for the pain you experienced, it could be due to many factors including but not limited to: inadequate lubrication, an infection, or an underlying medical condition.\n\nMy recommendation would be to take a home pregnancy test since you cannot recall when your last period was and you're worried about possibly being pregnant. You should also schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider who can properly examine you, evaluate your symptoms, and potentially order tests to rule out any infections or other conditions. \n\nUsing protection during sexual activities is crucial, not just to prevent unwanted pregnancy but also to avoid getting or transmitting STDs. Even if both of you believe that you don't have STDs, it's still possible to contract one without knowing. Many STDs are asymptomatic at first which means they don't show any symptoms until they've progressed. It's always safer to use contraception like condoms.

MRI before surgery and post-surgery are attached. Biopsy report is also attached. So, kindly help me to understand the biopsy report. Current medications are Encorate Chrono 500 mg twice daily, Thyronorm 50 mg. Current problems are weight loss, severe hair fall, less appetite, weakness, not able to eat or smell non-veg items, no hunger.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry but as an artificial intelligence model, I do not have the ability to view or interpret physical items such as MRI scans, biopsy reports, or any forms of medical images. However, I can provide some general information about a craniotomy and its possible symptoms and side effects.\n\nA craniotomy is a surgical operation in which a bone flap is temporarily removed from the skull to access the brain. It's often performed to remove brain tumors or treat other brain conditions.\n\nThe medications you mentioned, Encorate Chrono 500 mg (used for treating seizures) and Thyronorm 50 mg (typically used in the treatment of hypothyroidism), indicate that she might be dealing with seizure disorders and thyroid-related issues which could affect appetite and weight. \n\nPlease note that if your sister is experiencing significant weight loss, hair loss, reduced appetite, and weakness after her surgery, it's crucial to update her health care team right away. These are significant symptoms that need to be evaluated by a physician to determine whether they are the result of medication side effects, disease progression, or possibly another unknown condition.\n\nLastly, remember this interpretation should not replace a consultation with a healthcare provider. Kindly have these discussions with your sister's treating surgeon or physician who can understand and explain the context based on her complete medical history and current situation.\n\n## Output (b):\n What are your symptoms?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Is there any other treatment other than surgery? Please suggest.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nTreatment options for a femoral neck fracture greatly depend on the age of the patient, her overall health status and the type of fracture. The fact is that in many cases, particularly when there's significant displacement or angulation of the fracture, surgical intervention is usually needed to ensure proper healing and restoration of function.\n\nHowever, in certain situations with minimally displaced fractures, conservative treatments might be considered. This consists of minimal movement, rest, physical therapy, pain management, etc. Still, this approach bears a risk of nonunion or avascular necrosis due to altered blood supply to the femoral head that might result in chronic pain and loss of function.\n\nYou should discuss your mother\u2019s case with her orthopedic surgeon who can give you the best advice after evaluating her situation, taking into consideration the nature of fracture, her age, and her overall health condition.\n\n## Output (b):\n Can you please tell me your last name and date of birth?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

But we have had unprotected anal sex ten times so far. Can we be infected with HIV?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHIV is primarily transmitted through direct contact with certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. These body fluids include blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. Unprotected sex can certainly be a risk factor for transmission of HIV.\n\nHowever, if both of you are not HIV positive (and assuming you both have been tested accurately and haven't had sexual encounters with anyone else who could potentially be HIV positive) then it would generally be safe to say that your risk of contracting HIV from each other is negligible, because one cannot transmit what one does not have.\n\nNonetheless, do remember that unprotected sex can put you at risk for other sexually transmitted infections as well. Using protection such as condoms reduces this risk. Regular testing and communication about sexual health status with your partner/s are also important parts of maintaining sexual health.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer the questions below.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

And it has been about 4 1/2 weeks since my last menstrual period. Unfortunately with labor day being this weekend I have been unable to see my regular OBGYN. But I did go to the ER to confirm the pregnancy 2 days ago. So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth. I have been having bad panic attacks over this and cannot seem to relax as the complications of these medicines are always on my mind. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm very sorry to hear about your stress. It's important that you discuss these concerns with your OBGYN as soon as possible. However, in the meantime:\n\n1- Congratulations on your pregnancy! Your HCG levels do seem consistent with a 4-5 week gestational period.\n\n2- The medications you're taking can potentially cause issues but it doesn't mean they definitely will\u2014it varies from person to person and is always dependent on exact doses, frequencies and individual body responses. Please don't make any decisions out of anxiety till you get professional advice tailored to your situation.\n\n3- Don\u2019t stop your medication abruptly\u2014especially Lorazepam\u2014as this can cause serious withdrawal symptoms (which it seems like are starting to happen). This should be done under medical supervision.\n\n4- For benzodiazepines like Lorazepam and opioids like Percocet, there's an increased risk of complications for the infant such as developmental problems or withdrawal syndrome at birth. That said, some people have taken these medications during pregnancies and had healthy babies\u2014it all depends on the specifics.\n\nMy recommendation: Stay on your current dose until you can see your doctor. Try not to worry too much\u2014though I understand this might be hard given your state. Lots of women find out they're pregnant after having potentially harmful exposures and most often babies turn out fine. But scheduling an appointment with your regular OB-GYN ASAP is crucial so they can help you navigate through this.\n\n## Output (b):\n Can you give me a reason for the Percocet?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

It comes down from my chest, it kind of fills the gap from under the breast to the ribs. It is not hard, does not hurt nor is it sore. It is just squishy and soft like normal fat. Is it possible to get fat on just one side of the body like that?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYes, it is possible to have an uneven distribution of fat in certain areas, but it's not typically the norm. A lump or mass under your breast that you describe could indeed be a fatty deposit, which are often soft and movable under the skin. However, any new lump or mass should always be evaluated by a healthcare provider to rule out other possible causes, such as a cyst or lipoma.\n\nIt's important to report any changes in size, shape or symptoms associated with this mass\u2014 for example, if it becomes painful or starts growing rapidly, seek immediate medical attention. \n\nMoreover, if the distribution of fat is highly asymmetric (with much more on one side than the other), or if you notice asymmetry developing in other parts of your body, it might be worth discussing with your primary care physician as well. Some hormonal or metabolic conditions could theoretically cause uneven fat distribution, and these would need to be diagnosed via physical examination and possibly laboratory testing.\n\n## Output (b):\n Do you have any other questions for the doctor?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have high blood pressure problem from the last one month (silent BP) and my kidneys are damaging beacuse of this and my platelet count is 12 lakhs. These are continuously increasing from the last eight months, that is 6 lakhs, 8 lakhs, 11 lakhs and now 12 lakhs. My legs and foot pain are increasing day by day. Please reply as soon as possible.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm an AI and cannot provide direct medical advice, but I can share that these symptoms are serious. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to kidney damage. Additionally, platelet count you mentioned seems drastically elevated (normal range is typically around 150,000 - 450,000 per microliter of blood). Increased platelets may sometimes be seen due to inflammatory conditions, infections, cancer, or bone marrow disorders.\n\nLeg and foot pain could potentially be related to your circulatory system and the high platelet count could increase risk of clotting. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions before consulting with a doctor.\n\nPlease seek immediate medical care - consult your physician right away. Your healthcare provider may need to run more tests and prescribe treatments suitable for your specific condition. While medication can play a role in managing such conditions, lifestyle modifications will also likely be necessary.

Please advice.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, it is crucial to keep the area clean and dry. Wash gently with warm water and a mild soap if needed but avoid using harsh soaps or bubble baths as this can cause further irritation. If she's in diapers, change them frequently to prevent urine/fecal matter from coming into contact with the scratch.\n\nA gentle unscented moisturizer could also be applied, particularly one made for sensitive skin or even a diaper rash cream may provide some relief. However, avoid applying creams or ointments inside her vagina.\n\nMonitor the area for any signs of infection which include increasing redness, swelling, pus or developing fever. Also, look out for worsening pain or other changes in her urinary habits because these might hint toward an underlying urinary tract infection.\n\nIf your child remains uncomfortable or if you notice signs of an infection, reach out to her pediatrician.\n\nLastly, consider addressing potential causes for the scratching. Make sure her clothing and diapers are not too tight and that she is thoroughly cleaned during diaper changes. If the scratching is repetitive and persistent, it may indicate an issue like a yeast infection or simply discomfort, and should be evaluated by her pediatrician.\n\n## Output (b):\n How long has this been going on?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Enamel was removed to make room for the composite resin and the enamel is now too thin and feels sharp to the tongue\\s touch because of this. Shape and feel is not consistent with the natural front right tooth. Is there any way to fix this? Want to be as conservative as possible to avoid further damage.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nCertainly! From your description, it sounds like you're feeling a sharpness due to the thin layer of enamel on the tooth that received dental bonding or possibly the shape/edge of the bonded area. \n\nYour dentist can adjust and polish the treated tooth to make it smoother and more consistent with the natural tooth structure. This can generally be done without causing additional damage to the tooth since the adjustment is relatively minor.\n\nHowever, if the bonding material itself is causing discomfort, another possible option is removing the composite resin and reapplying it in a manner that provides a smoother transition and matches better with your natural tooth anatomy. \n\nRemember, it's vital to have an open conversation with your dentist about these concerns. You should be completely comfortable and satisfied with any dental procedure you receive.\n\n## Output (b):\n What are the patient's symptoms?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

But it tore in the middle of the act. But the guy did not ejaculate. I took unwanted 72 within 15 hours. I experienced withdrawal bleeding a week later that was quite normal like a period and lasted for four days. I took UPT which was negative. Can I still be pregnant?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on the information you have given, it is highly unlikely that you are pregnant. You took steps to protect yourself by using a condom and taking emergency contraception (Unwanted 72) within the recommended time frame after a potential risk of pregnancy occurred (the condom breaking). The emergency contraceptive pill (\"morning-after\" pill) works primarily by preventing or delaying ovulation; it does not terminate an existing pregnancy.\n\nThe bleeding you experienced was likely due to the hormonal fluctuation caused by the emergency contraceptive pill. A negative urine pregnancy test further supports that you're not pregnant, as these tests are typically accurate about one week after a missed period or two weeks after ovulation, which would be around the time you tested if your withdrawal bleed was similar in timing to your regular period. \n\nHowever, emergency contraceptives aren't 100% effective. If you feel concerned or notice symptoms such as nausea, abdominal cramping, breast tenderness, fatigue, frequent urination or if your next regular period is late, consider asking your healthcare provider for a blood pregnancy test which can detect smaller amounts of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) than a urine test.\n\nPlease remember that condoms not only protect against pregnancy but also sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so ensure they are used correctly and do not break.\n\n## Output (b):\n How long ago did you have unprotected sex?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Shall I try for a baby now?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's important to consult your primary surgeon or gynecologist for personalized advice. However, generally, in the case of open myomectomy surgery, it is often recommended to wait at least 6 months before trying to conceive to allow full healing of the uterine muscle and help prevent possible complications like uterine rupture during pregnancy. As for the Novelon; while it is primarily used as a contraceptive, it can also be prescribed to regulate menstrual cycles or manage endometriosis-related symptoms. If you are planning on getting pregnant, you should stop taking Novelon after discussing it with your healthcare provider. Remember, everyone\u2019s situation is unique, thus this communication should not replace professional medical advice and consultation.

I think it is due to the side effects of Perinorm tablets, which I was taking before six months. I am currently taking homeopathic medicines to remove my glass. Please suggest to me how to get rid of spectacles?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nMany factors can contribute to changes in vision, such as age, genetics, certain medical conditions like diabetes, or engaging in activities that strain the eyes. Current scientific evidence does not suggest Perinorm tablets (known also as Metoclopramide, a medication used to treat certain types of nausea and vomiting) cause an increase in myopia (-1.5 is a form of myopia or nearsightedness).\n\nAs for homeopathic treatments, there isn't strong scientific support that they are effective in reducing or eliminating the need for corrective lenses. \n\nHere's what you can do:\n\n1. Regular eye checkups - Optometrists recommend that adults have their eyes checked every one to two years.

I have taken Deanxit in the past. Then I stopped it for a year. I started taking it back again six months ago. I have a long flight to take soon. I have a fear of flying. Can I take one pill of Valium 5 mg while taking the Deanxit? So, that I can sleep on the plane. I am taking Femostan Conti, Concor 2.5 for heart palpitations.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nWhile it's always best to consult your personal doctor, in general, taking Valium (Diazepam) while on Deanxit is usually not recommended. Both these medicines have sedative effects and can potentially cause excessive drowsiness, difficulty waking up, decreased motor coordination and slowed reflexes among other potential problems. Formulaic medications like Concor 2.5 can also interact with Valium.\n\nHowever, considering that you are experiencing flight anxiety, a one-time usage might be considered. You should consult the doctor who prescribed these medications for a more personalised advice keeping all factors including your heart palpitations into consideration. \n\nRemember to inform them about all the medications you're currently taking so they could evaluate if Diazepam as an addition would be safe or not.

What might be the cause for it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBlack spots on the tongue could be due to a variety of causes:\n\n1. Hyper-Pigmentation: This occurs when there is excess melanin in your body. It's usually harmless and can occur in any part of the body, including the tongue.\n\n2. Oral Fibroma: This is a painless, non-cancerous bump that can appear anywhere in the mouth, including the tongue. They are often colored differently than the rest of the oral tissue.\n\n3. Hairy Tongue: This condition causes the papillae (small bumps on the surface of the tongue) to grow longer than normal, resulting in a black, hairy appearance. \n\n4. Oral Cancer: Although rare, black spots on the tongue can potentially indicate oral cancer. If you notice a spot that continues to grow or doesn't go away after two weeks, it's very important to get checked out by a doctor as soon as possible.\n\n5. Fungal infection: Certain fungal infections like oral candidiasis can cause black spots but this is less common.\n\nIf you're noticing new or persisting black spots on your tongue, it might be worth seeking medical advice so that a proper examination can be done to identify its cause.\n\n## Output (b):\n Do you have any other symptoms?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

We have done a urine culture as well as regular analysis and found that there is an infection. She has this problem from a long time. She has a bad habit of holding her urine for a long time until she can hold it no more.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry your daughter is having these issues. Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) can be caused by a variety of factors, one of which is holding in urine for prolonged periods, as this allows bacteria to grow in the urinary tract.\n\nThe mainstay of UTI treatment is antibiotics, to clear up the infection. This antibiotic treatment is usually continued for several days and it\u2019s important that she completes the full course, regardless of whether she feels better midway through the treatment. \n\nIn addition therefore, consider implementing some lifestyle changes:\n\n1. Encourage her not to hold in her urine when she needs to go, but rather, get her into the habit of using the bathroom regularly.\n2. Ensure she drinks plenty of fluids each day, particularly water, to help flush out any potential bacteria.\n3. Cranberry juice or supplement could potentially reduce frequency of UTIs (though further research is needed)\n\nIf the problem persists despite these measures, you may need to see a urologist, or a pediatrician who specializes in Pediatric Nephrology/Urology, for further workup. It may be necessary to check if there are anatomical problems with bladder emptying completely, or reflux of urine from bladder toward kidneys.\n\nRemember: She needs to be seen by a doctor in person though, always follow their direction - they know your medical history best.\n\n## Output (b):\n Ok, thank you for your time in taking this survey.

I was told it was found on venous Doppler looking at DVT. What all information can you tell me about the blood vessels having a pulse and it being a cardiac dysfunction? That is all I was left with until the cardiologist consult.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nCardiac dysfunction refers to a broad category of conditions in which the heart is not able to pump blood efficiently. This can occur for many reasons, including damage from heart attacks, high blood pressure, various forms of heart disease and conditions that overwork the heart.\n\nThe venous Doppler study you mentioned is used to assess the flow of blood in veins, often performed to detect or rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot within a deep vein usually in your legs. It uses ultrasound technology to produce images and sounds of the blood flowing through your arteries and veins.\n\nWhen we talk about 'blood vessels having a pulse', it's generally related to arteries rather than veins. Arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body and they do exhibit a pulse since blood pressure increases each time your heart pumps blood (systole). Veins, on the other hand, carry deoxygenated blood back towards the heart under substantially lower pressure so typically don't have a noticeable 'pulse'. \n\nHowever, some medical conditions can lead to pulsations in the big central veins situated closer to the heart. If an unusual 'venous pulse' was detected during your Doppler scan, it might suggest some type of cardiac dysfunction, possibly due to right-sided heart problems or other structural abnormalities. \n\nPlease keep in mind this is just a general explanation based on information given. Your cardiologist will give you a more accurate diagnosis after assessing all relevant tests and clinical\n\n## Output (b):\n\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My doctor said that I have an umbilical hernia.Either open surgery or laparoscopy, which would be the best? After which surgery, can I lift heavy weights?I am a sports person and a bodybuilder. Please suggest.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBoth open surgery and laparoscopic techniques have their own advantages in treating an umbilical hernia, and the best course of action really depends on individual factors like the size and severity of your hernia, your overall health status, and more.\n\nLaparoscopic surgery is a less invasive procedure with typically shorter recovery times compared to traditional open surgery. There's usually less post-operative pain, fewer complications, smaller scar, and patients are often able to return to normal activities sooner.\n\nHowever, heavy lifting and intense workouts can put strain on the surgical site and may increase chances for recurrence of the hernia or other complications. Regarding resuming these activities, you would need to follow the recovery plan as outlined by your surgeon regardless of which method is chosen. It generally takes several weeks up to a few months before one can return to strenuous exercise after hernia surgery.\n\nSince you're a bodybuilder who wants to get back to heavy lifting, it is very important that you have this discussion with your surgeon. They will be the best person to advise you based on the specifics of your situation, so I strongly suggest having a detailed conversation about your lifestyle and workout routine with them.

I have kept putting off seeing the dentist because of a high profile busy job. I have an upcoming appointment but am worried about a possible infection to the bone? If this is the case would I have severe pain and swelling?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHello! It's unfortunate to hear about your dental issues, but I'm glad you finally have an appointment set up. Persistent dental caries (cavities) can indeed lead to complications like tooth abscesses, which are infections that can potentially spread to the bone if left untreated for a long period of time.\n\nThe signs of such an infection could include severe pain, swelling in your face or cheek, sensitivity to heat and cold, fever, pus drainage, swollen lymph nodes and a bad taste in your mouth from drainage of an abscess. It must be noted however that everyone\u2019s pain threshold is different so you may not necessarily experience all or extreme forms of these symptoms.\n\nSince you know you have cavities it's very important to get this addressed as soon as possible. Antibiotics are usually prescribed initially to start fighting off any infection, followed by procedures to definitively address the source of the problem, which in this case would be treating the cavities.

I\\m 25 and just had a baby (naturally) 10 months ago. Back pain started at 8 months Postpartum .\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nOne-sided Sacroiliac (SI) joint pain can be caused by various factors. In your case, it's likely that pregnancy and childbirth have significantly contributed to the onset of this condition. \n\n1. Pregnancy and Childbirth: During pregnancy, hormones are released in a woman's body that allow ligaments to relax. This relaxation prepares the body for childbirth but can also lead to less stability in the SI joint, causing discomfort or pain. Moreover, natural childbirth can stress or injure the SI joints.\n\n2. Postural Changes and Body Weight: Carrying a baby changes a woman's center of gravity so they might change their regular posture without realizing it. Increased weight during pregnancy can put additional pressure on these joints as well.\n\n3. Musculoskeletal Changes: Sometimes the muscles around the sacroiliac joint may not recover totally after pregnancy which can cause imbalance leading to pain. \n\n4. Unilateral Stresses: Activities such as standing on one leg for long periods of time, climbing stairs, running, or any activity that involves loading more weight onto one leg can provoke SI joint dysfunction.\n\n5. Trauma or Injury: Any accidental trauma or injury in daily life can affect SI Joint resulting in pain.\n\n6. Degenerative Arthritis or Disease: Less likely given your age, degenerative arthritis or diseases like Ankylosing Spondylitis can affect the SI joints. \n\nIf you're still experiencing pain, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider who can help pinpoint the\n\n## Output (b):\n What makes it worse?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Sadly, I declined rapidly and lost all my hypotheaner and some of my lumbericals in a matter of six weeks. I was operated on exactly 14 weeks ago where I had a decompression of the ulnar nerve and an anterior interosseous nerve transfer to the motor component of the ulnar nerve so that the nerve axons would reach my hand quicker. I still have no improvement and I wanted to ask if it is possible to transfer muscle to fill in the hand? And will this protect my nerves in the hand? Would it be too soon to be considering this operation?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, it's important to remember that nerve recovery after surgery is usually a slow process, often taking months or even up to a year. Given the complexity of your surgical procedure (decompression and anterior interosseous nerve transfer), 14 weeks may not be sufficient time for noticeable improvement.\n\nRegarding your question about muscle transfer, it's indeed possible as a last resort - generally in cases where peripheral nerves aren't expected to regain function. Muscle transfers can help restore some functionality but may not necessarily 'protect' the nerves per se. However, this needs detailed evaluation by your treating doctor.\n\nI would recommend continuing your rehabilitation exercises and maintaining a close follow-up with your doctor in order to monitor the progress of nerve healing. You should explore all therapeutic options including muscle transfer only if there's confirmed non-progression of nerve regeneration over an acceptable duration of time. Your surgeon will advise you better on when to consider further intervention, as they have more knowledge about the specifics of your case.\n\nIt's very important to express your concerns to your doctor. Keep them updated with any changes or worries you might have concerning your recovery process.\n\n## Output (b):\n So you have heard from your doctor that the nerves did not recover.

For the past five months, I am undergoing this treatment. Prior to chemotherapy, I was taking ayurvedic medicine for the same problem. I took the medicine for about eight months, but it did not have any benefit. At that time, I was not aware of the exact problem. I was advised to remove the breast completely, but by the god\\s grace, I was referred to a doctor in oncology. The surgery has not been performed. They started with chemotherapy. Till now, I have completed five cycles. Still, how many cycles are needed for me? Will rest be given to me after the cycles? I am unable to eat, swallow or drink. I have lost my appetite. I have vomiting. Motions are happening from when I start eating my regular diet. I am feeling very depressed and demotivated. I have lost hope from the past five months. My left breast is healing and dressing is done over it. The skin is removed over a part. My breast looks flat as if it is removed. There is itching over the breast. Are there any chances for the regrowth of my breast? If yes, how many months will it take? If it does not regrow, what is the alternative for that?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm really sorry to hear about your struggle. Generally, a full course of chemotherapy for breast cancer can range from three to six months but it varies greatly depending on the type and stage of disease as well as personal health factors. The number of cycles you need specifically will depend on your oncologist\u2019s treatment plan. Sometimes, short breaks may be given between cycles based on patient's tolerance and response.\n\nYour symptoms like loss of appetite, difficulty swallowing, vomiting, and altered bowel habits are common side-effects of chemotherapy. Please communicate these concerns with your oncology team as there are medications that can help manage them.\n\nFurthermore, depression is not uncommon in patients undergoing cancer treatments. It's essential you discuss this with your healthcare provider as well; they can refer you to resources or professionals who can provide mental health support during this trying period.\n\nRegarding your left breast, after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (which you're currently receiving), standard management usually involves surgical removal of any residual cancer in the form of lumpectomy or mastectomy. Post-surgery, reconstruction procedures can certainly be discussed if the expected cosmetic result without intervention is unfavorable. Breast reconstruction can be done using implants or even natural tissue from other parts of the body. This typically happens several months after finishing chemotherapy. \n\nPlease know that every patient's situation is unique, and I advise discussing all your questions in detail with your treatment team who have all details related to your specific case.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Doctor, what is the complaint?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Her birth weight is 3.2 and now she is around 9 I think.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nEvery child develops at their own pace and just because your older daughter started speaking earlier, it doesn't necessarily mean your younger daughter should too. It's perfectly normal for some children to start speaking later than others. Expectations around language development tipically indicate that 2 year olds might say 50 or more words sprinkled with two-word sentences.\n\nRemember, comprehension precedes expression. If she's understanding what you're saying and following simple instructions, that's a good sign of her linguistic progress. However, if by the age of 2 she is only using very few words, cannot understand simple instructions, or fails to imitate words and sounds, please follow up with a healthcare professional as these could be red flags for a possible speech delay or disorder.\n\nIf this is the case, early intervention services such as speech therapy can help significantly. But most importantly, don't panic. A speech delay in an otherwise normally developing child might not signify anything more than taking a little longer to get talked up.\n\n## Output (b):\n The doctor will know best what to do.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

She had a fever of about 101.3 the day before yesterday. Our doctor advised her to take Oflox OZ and Sporolac DS. She has had five doses of Oflox OZ till now.The fever has gone and the number of motions has also reduced, though still watery but she is not eating anything. Her appetite is lost and even if she eats a little she complains of nausea though she is not throwing up. I am giving her Emeset for nausea. Is this a normal stomach infection?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe medications your daughter is currently taking, Oflox OZ (a combination of two medicines: Ornidazole and Ofloxacin) and Sporolac DS, are generally used to treat infections of the digestive tract. The symptoms you described - fever, vomiting, loose stool, loss of appetite - could be signs of a gastrointestinal infection, possibly due to bacteria or parasites.\n\nThe tendency to feel nauseous even after the symptomatic treatment with Emeset and reluctance to eat may occur because her digestive system is still recovering. It's also important to ensure she stays properly hydrated as diarrhea can lead to dehydration.\n\nHowever, if her condition does not improve in the next few days or if she starts showing new symptoms (like blood in stools, severe abdominal pain), it would be advised to consult with your doctor again. They might recommend certain investigations like stool analysis and decide on changing the course of treatment depending on its results.\n  \nKeep in mind that this advice is based on the limited information provided and should not replace a visit to a healthcare professional.\n\n## Output (b):\n Did she have a colonoscopy?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am so nervous about it. How to recover my tooth?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nRepairing a chipped tooth depends on the size of the chip and its location. There are several techniques your dentist might use:\n\n1. Dental Bonding: This procedure involves applying a putty-like resin to the damaged tooth that is shaped and colored to match your surrounding teeth. The resin is hardened with a UV light, effectively bonding it to the tooth.\n\n2. Dental Veneers: If you have a larger chip, a dental veneer could be an option. It's a thin shell made of porcelain or composite material placed over the front surface of the tooth.\n\n3. Dental Crowns: If a large piece of your tooth has broken off or if there's a lot of decay, a crown might be necessary. A crown is basically a cap for the damaged tooth.\n\n4. Dental Implants: In more severe cases where the tooth cannot be saved, it may need to be extracted and replaced with a dental implant.\n\nIn the meantime until you see a dentist, avoid biting down on hard food with the chipped tooth and try to keep the area clean. Over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage discomfort. Make sure you make an appointment with your dentist soon so they can examine your tooth and recommend the most appropriate course of treatment.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer the next question based on the doctor's answer.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

They came back down, and the dentist said they were fine. Now he is 4.5 years old, one of the teeth is ready to fall, and his dentist wants to pull out the other front tooth with a strong root. He says it is best if they both come out at the same time, but did not explain further. Is pulling an absolutely good tooth the best option? I am attaching the x-rays of the teeth.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to physically examine x-rays or any kind of images. However, I can provide some insight based on your description.\n\nThe extraction of a healthy tooth isn't usually recommended unless there are significant reasons for it. Situations that might prompt such a decision include the presence of overcrowding in the mouth, the need for orthodontic procedures or if the tooth is causing other oral health problems. \n\nFrom your description, it seems like your dentist thinks both teeth being absent at the same time could be beneficial - possibly because he or she foresees problems with the future adult teeth alignment or something similar.\n\nGiven your concern and not being able to fully understand the dentist's rationale, It would be wise to seek out a second opinion from another pediatric dentist or an oral surgeon. They will be able to review your case, look at your son's x-rays and give you more information based on their expertise. \n\nIt's important to acknowledge your feelings about this situation and advocate for what you believe to be best for your child's dental health. Healthcare decisions should involve shared decision making between doctors and patients (or their parents/guardians).\n\n## Output (b):\n Did the doctor tell you what he or she suspects is going on with your son?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My mother had exactly the same disorder like myself. She was diagnosed with an under active thyroid and autoimmune thyroid issue. On taking medication to sort her levels she has been free from the mental health problems.I recently started getting the issue again and took a thyroid function blood test. All levels were within range but my FT3 was slightly elevated at 8.97 pmol /L. I would love an expert opinion on if periodic FT3 level increases could be causing the anxiety, depression, and OCD issues. I am currently on Sertraline 150 mg. Coupled with my mother's exact issue, and cure, I am not sure what these results could mean? What should my next step be and could this elevated FT3 cause my anxiety to start?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nT3 plays a role in mood regulation, as there's considerable interaction between thyroid hormones and the nervous system. However, linking slightly high FT3 levels as the sole cause of your anxiety and OCD can be quite complex since mental health issues generally have multifactorial etiologies involving interplay between genetics, environment, brain chemistry amongst others. Furthermore, thyroid function tests are best interpreted considering all the values together such as TSH, FT4 along with clinical picture.\n\nGiven that your symptoms re-emerged recently, it'd be wise to get another full panel thyroid test (Free T3, Free T4, TSH, Anti-thyroid antibodies) done. This would ensure the initial value wasn't a random peak or lab error and whether any autoimmunity is involved like your mother. If these reports come back abnormal, you may be referred for further treatment by an endocrinologist.\n\nMeanwhile, continue taking your current medication and consider follow up with a psychiatrist/therapist to keep your symptoms under control. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been proven to help manage symptoms of anxiety and OCD. Remember proper sleep, regular physical activities, mindfulness exercises alongside a balanced diet helps to regulate overall health including mental well-being. Let me know if you need any more information!\n\n## Output (b):\n Before we move on, I have a few questions to ask about your mother's condition.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Black teeth could indeed be a sign of tooth decay or cavities but it might also be due to other causes such as staining from foods or tobacco. Here are some steps for care:\n\n1. Visit a Dentist: First and foremost, if you think you have tooth decay, it's crucial to schedule an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible. They will evaluate the condition of your teeth and provide appropriate treatment which may include fillings, crowns, root canals, etc.\n\n2. Brushing and Flossing: Until your dental appointment, make sure to regularly brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride-containing toothpaste and floss once daily to remove plaque that can lead to further tooth decay.\n\n3. Diet Control: Try to limit sugary drinks and snacks since these increase the risk of tooth decay. Drink plenty of water after meals to help wash away food particles.\n\n4. Professional Cleaning: Consider getting professional cleaning done by your dentist. This will help in removing any plaque or tartar accumulated on your teeth which can aid in preventing further decay.\n\n5. Use Mouthwash: Using mouthwash with fluoride can also reduce plaque and prevent tooth decay.\n\n6. No Tobacco: If you use tobacco products, consider quitting because they can cause staining and other oral health problems.\n\nRemember, not every discoloration of teeth is due to decay. So please visit your dentist to get a proper evaluation.

I removed the allergen from my diet and was prescribed Elidel to help clear the rash. However, I experienced over the course of two to three days, white patches which look as there is absolutely no pigment present in these areas. Will hypopigmentation from the use of Elidel fade? I was prescribed Elidel for the first time for a rash on my face. I am pale, but these are extremely white patches reminiscent of acne scars (but being completely flat). Is this likely to be permanent? Will it likely fade? If it may fade, how long would this likely take? What are my potential treatment options? No major injury to the sites was noticed aside from the generalized rash that was being treated.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nElidel (pimecrolimus) is a cream usually prescribed for eczema or other inflammatory skin conditions, and one of the potential side effects could be changes in skin color. However, while Elidel is known to occasionally cause skin lightening or darkening, these changes are generally not permanent once you stop using the medication. Nevertheless, it's important you discuss this with your prescribing doctor, to ensure there're no other underlying conditions that could impact skin pigmentation.\n\nHypopigmentation tends to improve over time after discontinuing the medication; however, how fast this occurs might vary from person to person. It depends on various factors such as the size and location of the hypopigmentation, the duration of the application, and individual skin healing capacities etc., making the exact timeline difficult to predict.\n\nIn terms of treatment options, if the white patches persist even after ceasing the use of Elidel, dermatologists have several ways to treat hypopigmentation:\n\n1. Topical corticosteroids: These medications can help if applied soon after the onset of the condition.\n2. Cosmetic camouflage: Creams, sprays, and lotions can temporarily color the skin.\n3. Microskin: A type of cosmetic cover-up that is waterproof and lasts for a few days.\n4. Tattooing small areas with color: This method doesn't work well in sun-exposed areas because they tend to fade.\n5.

My sugar level before three months was fasting 180 mg/dl, postprandial 253 mg/dl and HbA1C 8 %. After having medication, the test done a few days back showed fasting 93 mg/dl, postprandial 80 mg/dl, HbA1C 7 %, triglycerides 259 and VLDL cholesterol 51.80. Also, the blood pressure is 200/100 mmHg.I am taking the following medications:Glycomet GP 2 (one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening daily).Galvus 50 (one tablet in the morning daily).Tricinod 10/6.5 (one tablet morning daily).Cilamet XL 50 (one tablet evening daily).Neurokind LC (one tablet afternoon daily).Ecosprin AV 75 (one tablet evening daily).Trika 0.5 (one tablet evening daily).In the past, I was on Met XL 100 (one tablet in the morning daily), Met XL (one tablet in the evening daily), Stamlo 0.5 (one tablet in the morning daily), Ecosprin AV 75 (one tablet evening daily) and Gemer 1 (one tablet morning daily).Currently, my blood pressure is high and feeling heavy on in one side the of head and weak. Kindly suggest whether the medicine given above are correct and whether I can continue with the same or not.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour blood glucose levels have significantly improved, which is good news. However, your blood pressure is dangerously high at 200/100 mm Hg and needs immediate attention. High blood pressure can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other serious conditions.\n\nRegarding your medications:\n1) Glycomet GP 2 and Galvus 50: These are diabetes medicines and appear to be doing their job in controlling your blood sugar.\n2) Tricinod 10/6.5, Cilamet XL 50 & Stamlo 0.5: These are anti-hypertensives, used for treating high BP but it appears they are not currently providing sufficient control over your blood pressure.\n3) The Ecosprin AV is a combination medication which contains aspirin (anticoagulant) and Atorvastatin which lowers 'bad' cholesterol in your body. \n4) Neurokind LC is usually prescribed for nerve-related issues possibly due to diabetes, while Trika 0.5 is an anxiety medication.\n\nYou do need an urgent review of your treatment option by your doctor considering your current symptoms of elevated blood pressure and the associated heaviness on one side of the head and weakness. Some adjustments may need to be made either with dosages or adding different drugs to better manage the hypertension. \n\nAnother important aspect would be lifestyle changes - healthy diet, physical activity, reducing salt intake, quitting smoking if any, and limiting alcohol consumption.

The first day it was not a high temperature. I had difficulty swallowing and I had a sore throat. Today, the fever is 39.3 Celsius. I had tonsillitis three times before and I have been prescribed Co-amoxiclav, Dequadin, and Strepsils. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms suggest that you may have tonsillitis or even a strep throat. The high fever, difficulty swallowing, and sore throat are common symptoms. Since you've previously had tonsillitis, it could also be a recurrence.\n\nIf Co-amoxiclav has been prescribed to you before for this condition, it's likely because it is an antibiotic with good coverage against most of the bacteria that cause tonsillitis, including Streptococcus species.\n\nThis said, self-medicating, especially with antibiotics, can lead to misuse and antibiotic resistance. Therefore, given your symptoms, I recommend you seek medical advice as soon as possible.\n\nA rapid strep test or throat culture can confirm whether you have strep throat (caused by group A streptococcus), which requires antibiotic treatment to prevent complications. Alternatively, if these tests are negative, symptomatic treatment may be sufficient as viral infections often cause similar symptoms but do not necessitate or respond to antibiotic use.\n\nUntil you receive further care, keep hydrated, rest, and consider over-the-counter remedies like paracetamol to alleviate fever and pain.

The opening of my penis, from where the urine comes out is not at the tip, and it is slightly lower. I am still a virgin. Will it be a problem for my sex life? Is it a major problem?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt seems you have a condition known as hypospadias. Hypospadias is a birth defect in which the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip. This condition varies in severity; for some, the opening may be just slightly below the correct position, while in more severe cases it may be near or even within the scrotum.\n\nMild forms of this condition might not affect your sexual life significantly. However, if there are symptoms such as difficulty aiming urine, abnormal curvature of penis (chordee), inability to fully empty bladder or other symptoms related to penile function, it may affect your sexual health and fertility.\n\nI would recommend that you see a urologist who can evaluate your situation better and determine any required treatment. Treatment typically involves surgery to redirect the urinary pathway to the tip of the penis. Remember, there's no need to feel embarrassed when consulting with medical professionals about these issues - they're trained to respond to such matters with professionalism and care.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Is it painful when you urinate?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My cervical MRI did show moderate to severe changes throughout of narrowing of foraminal in all areas c3 to c7. Also flattening of ventral cord c3 through 6. I am anxious about it being multiple sclerosis.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to give a general framework based on your symptoms.\n\nTingling or numbness in various parts of the body could be due to several reasons. It's good that you've ruled out B12 deficiency as a cause for this time around since there was an improvement earlier with B12 supplements and your present levels are high. Also noteworthy is your normal neuro examination and head MRI results as it would rule out most neurological causes, including multiple sclerosis (MS). MS typically shows distinct abnormalities in these tests.\n\nThe changes mentioned in your cervical spine MRI might explain some of your symptoms as narrowing of the foraminal spaces (where spinal nerve roots exit) or compression of the spinal cord could lead to tingling/numbness sensations. This condition is often referred to as cervical spondylosis or cervical stenosis. However, it would not usually involve facial symptoms.\n\nIt could also be possible that the return of your symptoms has another cause entirely. Anxiety and stress can actually create physical symptoms like the tingling sensations you're experiencing. Other potential issues could include poor circulation, nerve conditions such as neuropathy or radiculopathy.\n\nAlways remember to discuss your concerns and review your findings with your healthcare professional before making any conclusions about your condition.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Now, my wife is again pregnant and has completed 26 weeks of pregnancy. She has developed antibodies and the latest ICT with titer test results show 1:64. Last week, we also did sonography and that did not have any impact on the baby.Now, the doctor suggests giving some steroids in this week which will help to develop the baby\\s lungs faster to prevent any complication. Is it safe? If my baby\\s blood group is also negative then are there any possibilities for antibodies to develop in my wife or does the baby\\s blood group does not matter at all? Should I go ahead with NIPT to find the baby\\s blood group?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour wife's pregnancy situation seems to fall under a condition called Rh incompatibility, which occurs when a mother has Rh-negative blood and her baby has Rh-positive blood. In your wife's case, she might have been sensitized (developed antibodies) during the first pregnancy if your first child was Rh positive.\n\nThe titre value you mentioned (1:64) is relatively high, suggesting that there are a significant number of antibodies present. High levels of these antibodies can cause complications for the baby, including hemolytic disease, hydrops fetalis, or even stillbirth in severe cases. \n\nHowever, it's encouraging that recent ultrasound scans shows no signs of anemia or Hydrops in the baby, indicating no negative effects so far. The physician's suggestion about injecting steroids will likely help speed up the maturity of your baby's lungs; this is a common practice recommended when there's possibly of early delivery, or in situations where the baby may require early intervention after birth due to conditions like Rh-incompatibility.\n\nIf your upcoming baby\u2019s blood group is also Rh negative, generally speaking, the antibodies your wife has won't affect this baby because they chiefly target Rh positive cells. But, given that antibodies are already present from previous exposure, careful monitoring is required.\n\nAs for the Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT), it's not just about determining the baby's blood group, but also about doing genetic screening for detecting certain chromosomal abnormalities earlier on.

I do not have any structural or plumbing heart issues. I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row. The EP I saw in the hospital prescribed me Flecainide 50 mg, twice daily. I saw another EP, who was a much older guy, as a second opinion. He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation. I do not agree with him on the ablation due to recent medical studies on WPW and how ablation is recommended even for asymptomatic patients, especially athletes.My question is regarding Flecainide. I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW. Do you think Flecainide at this dosage is safe and reasonable for the next two weeks, until my ablation?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nFlecainide is generally used to prevent certain types of life-threatening irregular heartbeats. Though it does carry some risks, it can be a valuable tool in the management of arrhythmias such as WPW syndrome. Common side effects include dizziness, vision changes, and nausea.\n\nRegarding your specific concern about the drug inducing dangerous rhythms - Flecainide has been known to exacerbate or precipitate certain types of ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in people with structural heart disease, which you mention you do not have. In your case, where it is being used short term (two weeks) leading up to an ablation procedure, this would typically be considered less risky. However, decisions like these should be individualized based on the specifics of your condition and risk profile.\n\nIt's excellent that you are proactively seeking out information and advocating for your health! Ultimately, this should be a discussion between you and your electrophysiologist. If you have concerns about taking Flecainide, even after this discussion, remember that you ultimately make the final decision about your treatment. Be sure to reach out to your healthcare provider if you notice any troubling symptoms or if you have further questions.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n I see. So, you have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and you are waiting for an ablation in 17 days.

I just want to know what Depakin are because my old psychiatrist gave me that medicine and I did not use it. It is about 5 months now but I do not feel good these days. I just feel depressed.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nDepakin, also known as Valproate or Valproic Acid, is a medication that's used to treat several conditions, including seizures, bipolar disorder and to prevent migraine headaches. It works by restoring the natural balance of certain substances (neurotransmitters) in the brain.\n\nIt's important to understand that everyone responds differently to medications, so if your psychiatrist prescribed this, it may have been with the intention of managing your depression symptoms. However, you should never start taking it without consulting your current healthcare provider first, especially after this much time has passed.\n\nIt's concerning that you're not feeling well lately. If your depression symptoms are getting worse or if you're having any thoughts about suicide, reach out to a healthcare provider immediately. You don't necessarily need to go back to your old psychiatrist - another medical professional like a primary care doctor, another psychiatrist, or even a certified nurse practitioner could help.\n\nRemember, there's no need to suffer in silence.

I am currently breastfeeding the younger one. I have a problem with my right breast which makes me doubt if it is something related to cancer. Nowadays it is getting really dry and there appear cracks on my nipple. I used Avalon nipple cream. But from yesterday my breast has shrunk and my nipples too. There are a few lumps on my nipple as well. Even though I apply cream it is not getting relieved. It is getting worse day by day.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear about your concerns. From what you told me, the symptoms you're experiencing could be related to breastfeeding including dry, cracked nipples and development of lumps (blocked milk ducts). Although a decrease in size might be due to reduced milk production or blocked ducts issues, any changes in your breasts including shrinking should be evaluated by a health professional to rule out any serious issues such as cancer.\n\nIt's important to remember that most breast changes are not cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked out to be on the safe side. I advise you to complete a clinical breast exam done by your doctor or a healthcare provider who can also suggest you the proper treatment for nipple soreness due to breastfeeding.\n\nRemember, early detection and diagnosis allow the widest range of treatment options.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you a doctor?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Could you please suggest any prevention tablet which can prevent the pregnancy after sex without any side effects?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYou may want to consider emergency contraception (\"morning-after pill\"), which can be used to prevent pregnancy after having unprotected sex. There are a couple of different brands available like Plan B One-Step, Take Action, AfterPill or Ella.\n\nPlan B One-Step (or its generic versions) can be taken up to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse, while Ella can be taken up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. \n\nHowever, please remember that these medications are most effective when used as soon as possible after the unprotected intercourse. They decrease in effectiveness over the course of those 72/120 hours. Also note that they are not meant to be used as regular birth control but rather for emergencies only. \n\nMost women can use morning-after pills with little to no side effects, the most common ones being nausea and vomiting, tiredness and headache, changes to your menstrual cycle, dizziness and abdominal discomfort. These generally do not last long.\n\nDespite their relative safety profile, it is always good practice to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any medication - to fully understand their benefits and potential risks. For a more long term family planning options I would recommend getting an appointment with a gynecologist so you can discuss contraceptive methods suited specifically for you possible side effects, etc.\n\n## Output (b):\n Hello doctor, she would like to know if any prevention tablet can prevent the pregnancy without any side effects.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have an abscess in my tooth for over a year now. I am getting it infected for the second time now. The previous infection was before six months. It is present at the bottom of one of my lower molars. It hurts me a lot. How long will it take to spread throughout the body?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's concerning that you've had an abscess for over a year now. Dental abscesses can lead to serious, potentially life-threatening complications if not treated promptly as the bacteria in an abscess can spread to other parts of your body through your bloodstream. \n\nThis spread could occur anywhere from days to weeks depending on various factors like your overall health, whether or not you're receiving any kind of treatment, how strong your immune system is, etc.\n\nHowever, I would strongly advise against waiting to see when it might spread and instead seek urgent dental care. Let a dentist examine you, assess the severity of the infection, and determine the best course of action which may involve draining the abscess, root canal treatment or extraction of the tooth, accompanied by antibiotics to clear up the infection.\n\nMoreover, recurrent dental abscesses could signify underlying issues such as poor oral hygiene, a high sugar diet, or existing dental conditions that need assessment and treatment. If you have systemic symptoms like fever, chills, swelling in your face or cheek, or trouble breathing or swallowing, they are signs that the infection has already begun to spread, this requires emergent medical attention and you should head straight to the emergency department of a hospital.\n\n## Output (b):\n Does the tooth abscess spread to your other teeth?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Right testicle swollen for the past five days and left testicle swollen for the past four days. On IV antibiotics, Cravit and Doribax (which replaced Rochephin). C-reactive test above 231. The doctors still cannot identify the cause. Any thoughts or recommendations? I have got ultrasounds but just shows increased blood, no abscesses.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your symptoms and initial efforts, it seems like you have been diagnosed with orchitis, which is inflammation of one or both testicles. It's usually caused by an infection and can be related to epididymitis - a tube that carries sperm from the testicle where inflammation can also occur because of an infection. \n\nOne common cause, especially for sexually active men under 35 years, is sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like gonorrhea or chlamydia. Another common cause is viral infections such as mumps in children who aren't vaccinated. These would typically present with other symptoms though or show up in lab results.\n\nGiven that antibiotics don\u2019t seem to be solving the problem, it could suggest this might not be bacterial but perhaps viral. But since you have had a fever for a continuous period of time and a C-reactive protein of 231 indicating significant inflammation, it suggests there's still an ongoing process. There's a chance your body is resistant to the antibiotic, or it could be an atypical bacteria.\n\nYour doctor might need to consider alternative diagnosis such as autoimmune orchitis or possibly even a rare form of cancer called testicular lymphoma which preferentially affects older individuals, although these are more rare possibilities. \n\nFurther investigation is needed. Typically doctors may run urine samples, STD tests to rule out possible causes, and may look into different scans if ultrasounds aren't providing answers.

Her bite is fine but her teeth are not properly aligned and she does not have bone on her left side. Her orthodontist referred her to a maxillofacial surgeon who says she needs her upper jaw broken and rotated clockwise and slightly up to compensate for the lack of bone and her bottom jaw also has to be broken and rotated clockwise. It would all then be held by plates and screws. My biggest concern is that she is a beautiful girl and he says that her face will not change at all. Is that true with this kind of procedure?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's completely understandable to be concerned about possible changes in your daughter's appearance from maxillofacial surgery. The kind of procedure being proposed, known as orthognathic surgery, is typically performed to correct functional problems, like improving \"bite\" or to help with sleep apnea, rather than to alter appearance.\n\nIn general, when done correctly by a skilled surgeon, the change in facial structure can be minimal and subtle. However, each individual\u2019s results may vary. Aspects such as swelling after the operation would temporarily alter her face but once healed, it should return to normal. One aspect to keep in mind is that these procedures do tend to highlight the patient's existing facial features, so this could slightly change the overall aesthetic look. \n\nI recommend you have an in-depth conversation with the maxillofacial surgeon. Ask if they can show you before-and-after photos of patients who've had similar procedures. You might also consider getting a second opinion for additional reassurance. \n\nRemember, the main goal here is to improve her oral health and quality of life.\n\n## Output (b):\n The doctor will know best, but these questions may help them understand your concerns.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Yesterday, doctors have checked my blood. I am visiting a hospital frequently as I have iron deficiency anemia. The thing I am scared about is, my doctor asked me why my ferritin has not increased (just the opposite, it has decreased from 5.79 to 5.77) after three months of taking iron supplements. My other iron levels are at 39 which has increased considering those references. But, that was probably because I did not use the medicine correctly, I was only taking 5 mg a day. Another thing I am worried about is, my lymphocytes kind of got increased in my blood: (52.8) - the reference is 19.4 to 44.9, and the other one is 3.57. My neutrophils kind of decreased too (36.9) and the reference was between 41.0 to 73.0.In the last week, I had a viral infection as both my parents were sick. Is it why my levels got high? My WBC is 6.77 and RBC is 4.52. My hemoglobin is also increasing actually, last time I checked, it was 11.0 and now it is 11.2. Still low, but it was good to see that it was increasing. My thrombocyte levels got higher again, unfortunately. The first time I was told that I was anemic, my thrombocyte levels were on 485, then in my second blood test (after using iron supplements correctly it decreased to 380. And yesterday, when I checked, it increased to 435 (reference is 156 to 373).I was also told that I have an infection in my urinary system and he gave me antibiotics. Honestly, I have been always getting suspected about it since my anemia has started. Should I be worried about my condition or is it normal?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, there are several things I would like to address regarding your condition.\n\nFirstly, Iron deficiency anemia is most commonly due to insufficient dietary intake or absorption of iron. So even if you're taking supplements, it may take some time for the body to absorb enough to replenish stores (represented by ferritin), especially if the oral dosage isn't high enough. The standard daily dose is usually above 150 mg, from which about 5-10% is absorbed. \n\nIncreased lymphocytes (which make up part of your white blood cell count) and decreased neutrophils probably correspond with the viral infection you mentioned. It's not unusual. When your immune system fights infections, these levels can change. It's also what could cause your thrombocyte (platelet) level to be a bit higher \u2013 it's an acute phase reactant and can increase during inflammation or infection. \n\nThough the increase in thrombocyte levels stands out slightly, its association with anemia is rather non-specific. It can be increased in an inflammatory response, which may be why it was raised after your diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. However, you should note that high platelet counts might also suggest other conditions including certain cancers, so regular follow-up is important.\n\nYour RBC count and Hemoglobin levels are indeed on the low side but showing improvement, which again supports the possibility that this just needs more time given that you were only taking a small amount of iron until now. Be sure\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your medical history.

These symptoms are troubling me a lot. I experience extreme nervousness, even when I do not have any emotional struggles. I have a feeling of having a fast heartbeat. At the age of 16, my blood report showed me a result of subclinical hyperthyroidism. I have done breast surgery. Due to my health concern, I always have my blood tested for thyroid.Before eight months, I also had done a Holter monitor, which showed my heart palpitations. On my final blood test, my thyroid results came normal. But still, I have the symptoms. I am trying for a baby. But I heard an issue that underlying or undiagnosed thyroid issue could become a terrible one during pregnancy. Do I need to consult an endocrinologist soon? Do these fluctuations are common in hyperthyroidism?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYes, your symptoms such as anxiety, nervousness, weight loss and fast heartbeat are consistent with an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). Even if your most recent blood test results came back normal, with your history of having subclinical hyperthyroidism as a teenager and persistent symptoms, there could be fluctuations in the thyroid hormone levels that aren't picked up in routine testing. \n\nThyroid disorders can indeed have adverse effects on pregnancy including fertility problems, recurrent miscarriage, preterm birth, and negative impact on fetal development. Therefore, it might be a good idea to consult with an endocrinologist soon. He/she will likely order additional tests and possibly start you on medication to manage your thyroid function better. Moreover, they'll provide advice tailored to your situation for when you're trying to conceive and during pregnancy. \n\nSo while fluctuations do happen in patients with hyperthyroidism, it's still a good idea to check-in with a specialist because managing your condition aims at providing you with a consistent, balanced amount of thyroid hormone in your body to keep your symptoms at bay. Please make an appointment with an Endocrinologist soon to address your concerns and best prepare for a healthy future pregnancy.\n\n## Output (b):\n Do you have a family history of thyroid problem?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have has this for years and it does not bother me. On the conjunctiva, it appears also a little puffy but I have noticed on the lacrimal caruncle there seems to be a red little spot. My eyes are always dry and I suffer from allergies. Is this of any concern or is it associated with dry eyes/allergies?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your description, it appears that you have a pinguecula, which is a common type of benign growth that can occur on the sclera, or white part, of the eye. Often, they form on the side of the eye nearest to the nose. Dry eyes and exposure to dust, sun, and wind are believed to contribute to their development. \n\nThe red spot on the lacrimal caruncle may be due to irritation or allergies. It could also be caused by minor infection. Observation for changes in size, shape, or color can be helpful, as well as for new symptoms like pain, itchiness, increased tearing, or discharge.\n\nWhile pingueculas and small irritations are usually nothing to worry about, any noticeable change in the eye should be checked out by an ophthalmologist just to be certain. Particularly if you feel persistent discomfort or observe worsening symptoms. Using over-the-counter lubricating eye drops (artificial tears) can help with dry eyes. However, in case of continuous dryness or allergic reactions, wrap-around sunglasses outdoors to protect from wind and sunlight, avoidance from allergens and use of anti-allergic eye-drops might benefit. But do consult with your healthcare specialist before starting any medications.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the patient's gender?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Can this disease make one blind?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHereditary Macular Degeneration (HMD), often referred to as Stargardt's Disease or Juvenile Macular Degeneration, is a genetic eye disorder that leads to progressive vision loss. It affects the macula, an area in the center of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces.\n\nHMD predominantly affects the macula, however, it can also harm other parts of the eye which results in further complications such as retinal dysfunction or even total visual loss in some extreme cases. Besides losing sharp central vision, you may also experience blurriness or haziness in your overall field of view, impaired color discrimination, and sensitivity to light.\n\nIt must be noted though that blindness due to HMD doesn't hold same significance as complete blackness or the inability to see anything at all. Most people with advanced stages of macular degeneration are considered legally blind because their vision is 20/200 or less, but they still have some peripheral or side vision remaining. \n\nThe exact prognosis varies significantly from person to person and depends on various factors like how early the condition is diagnosed, how fast it progresses, whether it affects one or both eyes, etc. Currently, there isn\u2019t a cure for HMD, but there are treatments available that can slow down its progression or help manage symptoms. Regular check-ups with an ophthalmologist and appropriate lifestyle adjustments can allow someone with this condition to maintain quality of life.\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your question.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My weight is 77 kg and height is 5 feet 6 inches. What is a skipping pulse? Is it blockage in the heart or not? My test reports is as follows, Cholesterol : 247, Triglycerides : 283, Hdl : 43, Ldl : 149, VLDL : 57, Non-Hdl cholesterol : 204, Lipoprotein a : 94, HS-CRP : 8, Sugar fasting : 90, and BP mostly : 130 / 85.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHello, \n\nA skipping pulse or heart palpitations typically refer to a feeling that your heart is beating too hard, too fast, skipping a beat, or fluttering. It might feel like your heart is racing or throbbing. This can be caused by various factors such as stress, anxiety, caffeine use, alcohol, tobacco, some medications and, in some cases, certain medical conditions.\n\nRegarding your query about blockage: it's not always the case that a skipping heartbeat indicates a blockage in the heart - which usually refers to coronary artery disease (CAD). Blockages are typically defined by symptoms like chest pain, breathlessness, fatigue etc.\n\nHowever, based on the results you've given me, it seems you have high cholesterol and high triglycerides. These findings place you at higher risk for developing CAD over time if not properly managed. Your BP reading of 130/85 is slightly elevated as well, flagging another cardiovascular risk factor.\n\nIt would also be worth noting here that having raised Lipoprotein(a) and HS-CRP levels could be indicative of inflammation and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. \n\nWhile there's no immediate cause for panic, these results signal a need for lifestyle adjustments - healthier diet, exercise, possibly medication - and regular monitoring. \n\nFinally, I'd suggest getting an EKG or Holter monitor test done to evaluate your skipped heartbeats more precisely. It\u2019s always wise to have a detailed discussion with your local healthcare provider, who knows about your\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the patient's age?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am currently taking WP Thyroid. I have taken Armour and Nature-thyroid. They all make me sick to my stomach. I tried adding generic T3 and it made my symptoms worse, that is, hair loss, cold hands and feet, weight gain, fatigue, GERD, and constipation. Would a synthetic T4 and T3 be better for me such as Tirosint and Cytomel?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like you've been having a tough time managing your hypothyroidism, I'm sorry to hear that. It's quite possible that a synthetic T4 product like levothyroxine (Tirosint) might be easier on your stomach than the natural thyroid medication you are currently taking. However, since you experienced worse symptoms when additional T3 was added into your treatment, adding Cytomel might not be best for you. Please keep in mind that switching medications should always be discussed and supervised by your doctor or endocrinologist, who can monitor your Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels and adjust dosage accordingly.  \n\nAnd remember, apart from medication adjustments, addressing lifestyle factors can sometimes help manage hypothyroid symptoms as well. Regular exercise, a balanced, nutrient-rich diet, and stress management measures could improve your symptoms. So could finding ways to promote healthy gut function given your issue with GERD and constipation - this could involve changes in diet, exercise, stress management, staying well-hydrated, and possibly using supplements or medications aimed at gut health.\n\nIn conclusion, while changing your medication might be an option, it\u2019s imperative to do so under professional care.

My doctor prescribed Prednisone 10 mg two tablets daily for 10 days for a cough. However, since taking Prednisone, my insomnia had worsened dramatically. I stopped taking Prednisone after 10 days, but my insomnia had not improved. Is insomnia a permanent side effect of Prednisone?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nNo, insomnia is typically not a permanent side effect of Prednisone. It's indeed one of the common side effects while taking it but usually resolves itself after stopping the medication. However, prednisone should never be stopped abruptly and should always be tapered off as per medical advice to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Given that insomnia has continued even after discontinuing Prednisone, it could be related to other factors such as your depression or possible interactions between Trazodone, Luvox and Prednisone. It's recommended you discuss this with your healthcare provider so they can reassess your treatment plan and offer solutions for your insomnia.

A month ago, I had a heart stroke and underwent angio for blood clotting thrombus. My CBC report at that time shows a platelet count at 24 lakhs. I received CALR Exon 9 mutation analysis report today. It reads \"CALR Exon 9 mutation is detected by PCR amplification of Exon 9 of CALR, followed by sequencing of coding and junctional region of the Exon. The sequence is compared with the reference sequence NM-004343 for the analysis of mutations.\" Hematologist prescribed me Anagrelide 0.5 mg. Do I have to worry? Can it be cured by medication?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear about your recent health challenges. Based on the information you provided, it seems like you have an abnormally high platelet count and a CALR exon 9 mutation, both of which can be associated with certain blood disorders such as Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) or Primary Myelofibrosis(PMF). \n\nThese are chronic conditions that typically cannot be \"cured,\" but definitely can be managed effectively with proper treatment and follow-up. The goal of treatment is to prevent complications, mainly clotting events and progression of disease. Anagrelide, the medication prescribed by your hematologist, helps in decreasing platelet counts and is often used for treating these conditions.\n\nThis situation should be monitored closely under the care of a hematologist. You need regular clinical examinations along with periodic blood cell counts and others tests as required. Lifestyle changes including quitting smoking, staying active, maintaining a healthy diet and weight can improve your overall health condition.\n\nRemember to also address any cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol levels, and diabetes to reduce the chance of strokes in future.

While I am sleeping, I get up just once to urinate, sometimes not at all. Do you think I have diabetes? I got my blood sugar checked, and it came out as perfectly normal (91, normal range is 80-100 for fasting). I think it is highly unlikely I am going to get diabetes in less than two years after the last checkup, but I wanted to confirm since my family has a history of this illness, and that is scaring me a bit. I am a 28-year-old male with asthma and acid reflux.I am currently on Montelukast, Advair and Omeprazole.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nFrequent urination and excessive thirst can be symptoms of diabetes, but in your case since the recent blood sugar levels are normal, it is less likely. However, uncontrolled diabetes usually causes nocturia (nighttime urination), which you said you aren't experiencing frequently.\n\nGiven your family history of diabetes, fear about the disease is understandable, but remember that not everyone who has a family history will develop it. Lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and body weight also play into the development of type 2 diabetes.\n\nYour medications--montelukast for asthma, Advair (fluticasone/salmeterol) also for asthma, and omeprazole for acid reflux--none appear to directly cause frequent urination or extreme thirst as side effects.\n\nIt's worth mentioning dehydration, urinary tract infections, and certain kidney conditions could also cause frequent urination and excessive thirst. If these symptoms continue it would be beneficial to see your doctor so they might look at other possible reasons behind these symptoms; urine tests or further checks on your kidney function may be necessary just to rule out those other possibilities.\n\nStay well hydrated, maintain good eating habits, get regular exercise, and manage stress where possible--all this supports overall health including that of kidneys and urinary system. Choose water mostly and be careful with drinks like coffee, tea, and sodas, which have diuretic properties and may increase urination. \n\nIn conclusion, although an increased thirst along with frequent urination often suggest\n\n## Output (b):\n Can you tell me what you are taking the medication for?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Since it's occurring only for brief periods of time, possible causes could be changes in light or focus, different emotional states like stress or anxiety, or use of certain medications.\n\nHowever, if you are experiencing a significant and noticeable change in pupil size that isn't related to a change in light, emotions or medication, this could potentially indicate a medical condition such as Horner\u2019s syndrome or Adie's pupil among others.\n\nTherefore, I recommend scheduling an appointment with an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) to have your symptoms evaluated.

Is this the effect of water. Kindly suggest the medicine for this problem.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nWhite or gray hair is a common issue generally caused by the reduction of melanin production in hair follicles as we age. Genetics plays a crucial role with this too. However, white hair at an early age could also indicate vitamin deficiencies (B12), thyroid disorders, stress, smoking or even the prolonged use of certain medications. Bad water quality may affect the health of your hair but it's rarely the primary cause of graying.\n\nWhile I cannot prescribe medications without a thorough examination, you can consider incorporating nutrients necessary for melanin production into your diet. This includes foods rich in copper such as almonds, spinach, blackstrap molasses, milk and eggs. Vitamins B12, B6, folate, E, and D are also important. You might benefit from a multivitamin supplement as well.\n\nAside from maintaining a healthy diet, reducing stress is recommended. Regular exercises, yoga and meditation can help with stress management. \n\nIt\u2019s essential that you discuss this matter with a healthcare professional who can guide you better based on a detailed medical history and if required, run some tests to rule out any possible underlying medical conditions. They can recommend suitable treatments including potential medical intervention if necessary.\n\n## Output (b):\n Was the white hair there before you started using water?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Please see the attached picture. Involuntary frowning causes lines to run through the scar, can this be causing problems? Is it worth taping my forehead, so I cannot make frown lines? Is it worth getting a botox to stop frowning till I am healed? I am using a vitamin C and silicone scar cream to attempt better removal of hyperpigmentation. Is this a problem? I cannot tell if it is this or the creasing making it worse. I am starting to get very depressed about this scar revision. It was bad enough getting mugged and getting this wound. Now it is not healing even after a scar revision surgery. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear about your experience and your current concerns with regards to healing after scar revision surgery. Without an in-person examination, I can't provide a definitive diagnosis. However, here are some general suggestions:\n\n1. Lines running through the scar due to frowning might contribute to the consistency of the scar because this recurrent movement could disturb the new tissue formation process. Taping may be beneficial but should be done under instructions from a healthcare professional.\n\n2. As for botox - it is an option that might help reduce facial movements during the healing process which may theoretically result in a better cosmetic outcome. This must be discussed with your surgeon or a dermatologist though, as it is not usually a part of regular post-operative care.\n\n3. Vitamin C and silicone scar creams are generally safe, and commonly used post-surgery to enhance collagen production, blend pigmentation and smooth out the appearance of scars. If you think they are causing discomfort or worsening the scar, discontinue use and consult your primary physician or plastic surgeon.\n\n4. Mental health is also important in this healing process. You might consider talking to a psychologist or counselor to address feelings of depression related to this issue.\n\nIn light of your concerns, please contact your primary physician/surgeon immediately or find a professional wound care consultant to guide you based on an in-person examination.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is the patient male or female?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

But due to severe negligence and work, I could not do that. It is almost a year now, and tonight I am having a painful time. Please tell me whether there is a chance of spread of infection. Please help. My infected tooth is the right first molar of the lower jaw.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIf you are experiencing severe pain a year after your dentist recommended root canal therapy, it is likely that the infection has remained or worsened. In some cases, the infection can potentially spread into your jaw bone, to other teeth, or even become systemic and affect your overall health.\n\nSymptoms of a spreading dental infection may include fever, general discomfort or illness, and swelling in your face or neck. While I can't diagnose you over online chat, I strongly recommend seeking immediate professional care if you're experiencing any of these symptoms. \n\nDon't put off scheduling an emergency appointment with your dentist. Untreated dental infections can lead to serious complications such as abscesses or sepsis, which need to be handled quickly to prevent further harm.\n\nThis doesn't mean that your case will definitely have these complications but given the severity of your pain, it's essential to seek urgent care. Please go to your dentist (or to the hospital if you experience things like high fever or facial swelling) soon because early treatment often makes a big difference.\n\n## Output (b):\n I'm the doctor. Based on your description, the infection may have spread to the surrounding teeth and gum. You should visit a dentist as soon as possible to prevent further complications. It's important to seek medical attention if you experience severe pain or swelling in your gums, as this could indicate an abscess or other dental infection. Regular dental checkups and proper oral hygiene can help prevent these infections and maintain your overall oral health. I recommend scheduling an appointment with a dentist as soon as possible.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Now I have a pain in that tooth which got worse this morning. My cheek and throat have a sore, and they are swollen. It became a deep cavity when my filling fell out.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like you may have a dental abscess or an infection. This often happens when a cavity is untreated and bacteria gets into the pulp of the tooth, causing inflammation and pain. The swelling in your cheek and throat could also be signs that the infection has spread.\n\nYou should seek immediate dental care. The dentist may need to perform a root canal treatment or potentially extract the tooth if it's not salvageable. Additionally, antibiotics may be required to manage the infection. Please avoid delaying this as it can lead to more severe issues such as sepsis (a body-wide infection), especially if the infection has already begun to spread. Rest assured, with proper treatment, this condition can be managed well.\n\nPlease note: If you start to experience difficulties swallowing or breathing, fever, or other serious health changes, please consider these as emergencies and visit the emergency room immediately.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer the questions to help us diagnose the patient.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

A few days ago, I had a toothache on my molar teeth and have mobility when touched. I have a big hole in that tooth from my childhood. I guess the black circle is the vein of the tooth. I could not afford to get an implant tooth. I had pain in that tooth a year back and then now. Is it possible to cure with rebuilding this tooth instead of removing it? Here is the picture for your reference.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm an AI and being a text-based model, I can't view or analyze pictures. However, based on the symptoms you've mentioned, it sounds like your tooth decay may have progressed to where the pulp (the nerve and blood vessels) of the tooth is exposed. This generally causes pain and sensitivity. The tooth's movement comes from damage to the structure holding it in place, which could be due to severe decay. \n\nWhile it depends on the extent of the decay, if it's as advanced as you describe, rebuilding the tooth might not be an option and extraction might become necessary. It would best to visit a dentist in person to understand all possible options. They might suggest a root canal treatment too if some healthy structure is left. Regardless of the treatment method, make sure you get this checked out urgently, untreated dental issues may lead to infections or other complications.\n\n## Output (b):\n The doctor will receive your request and answer it in 1-2 days.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am under Macfolate and Metformin tablets for the past seven months. I have regular periods for the past six months. This month, on the 11th day, I missed my period. After two days, when I checked for pregnancy, I got a negative result. Again after seven days, I got a negative result after checking for pregnancy. I am getting mucus discharge in small amounts. It does not have any foul odor. Am I pregnant? Why is it showing negative?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nPregnancy tests work by detecting the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which your body starts producing after implantation of an embryo. Most home pregnancy tests won't register a positive result until around the time you would expect to get your period. If it is still negative more than a week past your missed period, it's unlikely that you're pregnant. However, varying cycle lengths and ovulation times can sometimes cause this to be misleading.\n\nThe mucus discharge you described isn't specifically a sign of early pregnancy. While cervical mucus can change during cycles and throughout pregnancies, it isn't considered one of the early signs of pregnancy, like missing a period or experiencing morning sickness.\n\nYour Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) might also play a role in an irregular menstrual cycle. PCOS can lead to hormonal imbalances that affect your cycle even when taking metformin and Macfolate.\n\nIf you did not have your periods for a month but pregnancy test still shows negative, it will be good to consult with your healthcare provider. They may do another pregnancy test, a blood test, or further investigations depending on your circumstances to figure out why you've been missing periods. It's essential to keep communication open about your concerns and symptoms, as everyone's experiences are unique.\n\n## Output (b):\n 2nd part\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

The pains are so sharp, and I can see my wisdom teeth coming out like a halfway through, it is so painful, what should I do?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms suggest you may be experiencing pericoronitis, which is inflammation of the gum tissue around a partially emerged wisdom tooth. This condition can cause pain, swelling, difficulty chewing and biting, and sometimes even infection. I advise you to maintain good oral hygiene in order to minimize your risk of infection - brushing and flossing regularly, rinsing your mouth with warm salt water several times a day can provide some relief from the discomfort. However, these are only temporary solutions. \n\nThe definitive treatment for this problem is typically removal of the impacted wisdom teeth. It would be best to set up an appointment with a dentist or oral surgeon as soon as possible to have the area evaluated. They can determine the position and health of the wisdom teeth and recommend whether or not extraction is needed.\n    \nIn the meantime, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can help manage the pain.

She underwent a biopsy. In the biopsy report, it came as benign. Another test showed that she has stage 3 breast cancer (she has no symptoms) and the doctor advised us for a mastectomy. The doctor recommended us to do some tests such as blood count, breast X-ray, and ultrasound. The results came normal (there is no mass lesion present, and there is no metastasis seen). Is there any confirmatory test available to find breast cancer?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYes, there are several additional diagnostic tests which can provide more information regarding the presence and extent of breast cancer. From what you have said, it seems like there might be some inconsistencies between the biopsy report which showed benign findings and the other test indicating stage 3 breast cancer.\n\nA second opinion or re-evaluation could be very helpful. Here are some of the tests that would be usually recommended:\n\n1. Repeat Biopsy: Given the discrepancy in the reports, it may be advisable to conduct a repeat biopsy for another histopathological examination.\n\n2. Mammography: A mammogram is an X-ray picture of the breast that can show abnormalities and detect early signs of breast cancer. In this case, doing a digital tomosynthesis (3D mammography) might give a better view of the breast tissue.\n\n3. Breast MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging gives a much-detailed picture of the breasts than a mammogram and helps differentiate malignant from benign tumors.\n\n4. PET/CT Scan: This is useful for checking if cancer has spread (metastasis), although it's not typically used for initial diagnosis.\n\n5. Genetic testing: Sometimes done when a strong family history of cancer exists. Some types of breast cancer are hereditary, caused by abnormal genes.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to remember that every patient is unique, and individual treatment plans will depend on numerous factors including age, overall health status, and specific disease characteristics.

With water, there is also some thick semi-liquid discharge from sides. These symptoms are also accompanied by some heaviness in the eyes. I believe this is contagious as one another family member of mine is facing the same issues.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour mother's symptoms suggest a case of conjunctivitis, also known as \"pink eye\". Conjunctivitis can be caused by a viral or bacterial infection, an allergic reaction, or in babies an incompletely opened tear duct. It often spreads easily, especially in close contacts like families. Common symptoms include redness, itching, a gritty feeling, tearing, and a discharge which could be clear or may become thick and stringy. In addition to these, the heaviness could be because of inflammation induced by the infection or allergy.\n\nYou should ensure she gets evaluated by a healthcare provider immediately. The treatment will depend upon whether it is bacteria or virus causing the problem. Antibiotic eye drops or ointments will be prescribed if it is bacterial. Viral pink eye tends to follow its own course over 1-2 weeks, similar to a common cold. \n\nUntil then, practice good hygiene including washing hands often, not sharing towels or pillows, avoiding touching her eyes, etc., to avoid spreading the infection further. Over-the-counter eyedrops may help with symptoms, formulated for relieving itchiness and inflammation (like those containing antihistamines) might bring relief \u2013 but they won't treat the underlying cause and hence should not replace medical consultation and treatment.\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the patient's age?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I can see fully clear when it is about 5 to 10 cm from my eye (letters) but it became blurry when the distance increases. Right eye is pretty fine but left eyes are not proper as right. So what kind of medication do I need?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe symptoms you're describing suggest digital eye strain or computer vision syndrome, which can cause blurry vision, headaches, dry eyes, and neck and shoulder pain. This usually happens due to prolonged screen time without breaks.\n\nYou should:\n\n1. Rest your eyes: Try to take a break every 20 minutes by looking at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.\n2. Adjust lighting: Ensure the room light isn't too bright or too dark.\n3. Modify computer settings: Increase text size for easier reading, adjust screen brightness and contrast.\n\nIt's also important to remember that these are only temporary solutions. If problems persist, it might indicate presbyopia (difficulty focusing on near objects), myopia (near-sightedness), or some other issue. You need to get an appointment with an optometrist for a comprehensive eye examination to rule out any medical issues. \n\nYour doctor might prescribe eyeglasses with anti-glare lenses, regular use of artificial tears if dryness is present, or recommend eye exercises.

It could potentially be related to your underlying conditions of Raynaud's phenomenon and cutaneous vasculitis. Vasculitis can certainly cause changes in the skin, including a red rash with darker center spots, which are often signs of inflammation or blocked blood vessels due to inflammation.\n\nHowever, these symptoms may also suggest other conditions similar to insect bites or stings, dermatitis, fungal infections, or even certain types of skin cancer. \n\nI would advise you to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a dermatologist as soon as possible for a thorough assessment. They will probably want to take a closer look, possibly do some tests, and discuss your complete medical history before landing on a diagnosis.

I have gone to one of the dentists and she suggested me to get a root canal treatment done but I feel that the pulp or tissue of that tooth is not yet damaged and can be recovered without doing a root canal. I am attaching a picture of my tooth. Kindly suggest me whether the root canal is needed for this or I can save my tooth using some other methods?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs an AI, I'm unable to physically review photos or conduct a physical examination. However, based on your description, tooth sensitivity after eating hot or cold foods, and intermittent pain could indicate possible nerve damage, dental decay, or gum disease.\n\nThere are less invasive treatments than a root canal that can sometimes address these issues, but it really depends on the actual condition of the tooth and extent of potential nerve damage or decay. It's important to trust your dentist's expertise as they have conducted physical evaluations and possibly x-rays of your tooth.\n\nIf you're unsure about the need for a root canal, consider getting a second opinion from another dentist.

At that time, my vision in the right eye was hand movements only and I was diagnosed with a macular injury. Three months later, my vision slowly improved to 6/36. However, my right eye started to deviate (exotropia) and I started experiencing diplopia. My main problem is diplopia. I have used prisms, but of no use. When I try to focus on an image, I have severe diplopia. The diplopia disappears when I try to correct the squint. At present, I am doing higher studies and the diplopia is really bothering me. Will doing a squint surgery be of any use? Is there anything that I can try?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your description and history of injury, it seems like strabismus surgery (squint surgery) to correct the misalignment of the eyes could indeed help lessen or potentially resolve the diplopia you're experiencing. The purpose of this surgery is to align the muscles in your eye so that they can work together successfully. However, keep in mind that each patient's condition is unique and success rates may vary based on factors like severity of squint, age, previous history etc.\n\nSince prisms have not been effective for you, discussing alternate options like surgery with your ophthalmologist would be appropriate. They will perform a thorough assessment including tests such as synoptophore and prism cover test to assess the amount of deviation between your eyes. Depending on where the muscles are attached during surgery, the direction your eye points to can change. It might need more than one operation to do the trick since exact levels of adjustment sometimes require trial assessments.\n\nRemember also that continuing any recommended eye muscle exercises post-surgery will maximize success rate. Adequate recovery time after the surgery is important before going back to activities that require intense visual focus.\n\nIn addition to considering the surgery, do evaluate if anything else (e.g stress, lack of sleep), is causing the diplopia symptom to worsen. Also, consult your doctor if there are other therapeutic strategies you should consider as well.\nOverall, a considered discussion and consultation with your ophthalmologist is required to make an informed decision about whether squint surgery\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer questions based on your medical training and experience.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I also have an upper molar that is broken decayed and has been like this for years. The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw. The dentist had said the next thing she could give me was Clindamycin, but I have a fear of the side effects of that medicine. I already have heart problems and mild stomach issues. I have read that Clindamycin can cause severe gastrointestinal problems and arrhythmias. She also suggested Zithromax, but I have had heart palpitations while on that medication as well. I am having the teeth removed by an oral surgeon in two weeks, but am afraid of dying from infection before then. What are my options? What is the best course of action? Are there other antibiotics for this? Am I dying from the infection already? Any of your advice or help is appreciated. My other possibly relevant health history is as follows: I have high blood pressure, tachycardia, high cholesterol and mild PVC\\s. I had a MRSA infection in my arm 10 years ago. I have many strep throat infections every year and frequent sinus issues. Also, I would like to mention that when I took smoothed Cephalexin capsule with a sip of water, I got a random salty taste in my mouth.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nFirstly, it's important for you to stay calm because anxiety can make you feel even worse. From your description, it seems like you have a dental abscess caused by the infected wisdom tooth and possibly the decayed molar as well. Yes, untreated dental infections can potentially spread and cause serious complications, including infections in the heart or brain but those outcomes are rare and occur when infection is left untreated for extended periods of time.\n\nYou are currently on antibiotics and with good oral hygiene, the chances of this sort of spread become minimal before your scheduled oral surgery. The pus oozing from the wisdom tooth suggests that at least the abscess has an outlet preventing build-up, which is partly a positive thing. Nevertheless, continuous oozing of pus could mean an ongoing uncontrolled infection and may necessitate a change of antibiotics.\n\nClindamycin is a strong antibiotic used commonly in dental procedures especially when resistance or allergy to other antibiotics is reported. Side effects can happen with every medication, but not everyone experiences them; they tend to occur more frequently at higher doses. However, given your fear, history of heart problems, and stomach issues, it would be better to consult your healthcare provider about your fears and observations before taking Clindamycin or Zithromax again. There are other antibiotics available, such as Metronidazole or Amoxicillin, but your doctor will prescribe what is best suited to your condition considering your medical history.\n\nThe salty taste you experienced after taking Ceph\n\n## Output (b):\n Did the dentist say anything about the pain level in your jaw?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I had visited a dentist for a check-up. He did X-ray of my teeth and told me that food stuck between molar teeth and wisdom teeth is causing pain. So he advised me to remove wisdom teeth and filling process. But I am scared that upper teeth have a connection with brain and eyes. So, the process of teeth removal can harm my eyes and brain. Please advise me what I can do. If I do not remove my teeth, then what will be its side effect?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's common to feel anxiety about dental procedures, especially extractions. However, please rest assured that your upper wisdom teeth do not have a direct connection with your brain or eyes. The body certainly has intricate connections throughout, but the process of removing an upper wisdom tooth will not physically harm your brain or eyes. Modern dentistry techniques are safe and precise. Dentists are skilled professionals who have extensive training and experience dealing with such scenarios.\n\nIf food is constantly getting stuck between your molar and wisdom tooth, this can lead to repeated infections, cavities, and pain. This is likely why your dentist recommended extraction. Keeping the tooth can also cause other problems like malalignment of adjacent teeth, pericoronitis (inflammation around the tooth), formation of cysts or tumors in rare cases, and difficulty in maintaining oral hygiene leading to gum diseases. \n\nThe decision whether to remove or not should be based on professional advice considering your overall dental health status. If you're still feeling uncertain, it may help to seek a second opinion from another dentist.\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your question.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Your symptoms and the positive Widal test suggest you might be suffering from Typhoid fever, a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella typhi bacteria. High eosinophil count does not typically correlate with typhoid fever but may indicate allergies or more commonly parasitic infections. Paired with your vomiting and fatigue, it's difficult to give an accurate diagnosis without more information - these could potentially signal issues ranging from simple food intolerances to more severe liver diseases.\n\nPlease seek immediate medical attention as early as possible as both typhoid fever and liver conditions are serious diagnoses that need appropriate intervention and management. Please ensure to stay adequately hydrated in the meantime. Further investigations such as blood and stool cultures, complete blood counts, repeat LFTs, and possibly imaging (like ultrasound) should be done under guidance of your physician based on physical examination findings.

There are no signs of it from the last one year. However, she has these bulging eyes all the time, but she can perfectly see everything with her spectacles. I do not really know what happened to her the other day. She was watching her favorite TV show and all of sudden, her right eye popped out of her eye socket and she started shouting. It was such a scary and frightening situation where I and my dad did not know what to do and out of nowhere, my dad suddenly pushed her eye with a little pressure and the eye was back in its position as usual. My mom experienced severe pain after this incident when she was rushed to an Ophthalmologist. The doctor had no clue about the reason for her eye pop out. However, I advised her to go through a few medical tests and the results are yet to come. Meantime, I just want to understand why this happened to her and will this happen regularly and what is the treatment needed to prevent this from happening again. I just do not want to think of any situation where she is alone in the home and the same happens to her. I just want her to be completely cured from this one. Please help me with my query.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like your mother experienced what is called \"globe luxation,\" a condition where the eye globe (or eyeball) protrudes from its socket. This can be terrifying, but usually doesn't cause permanent vision damage if treated quickly. \n\nThere are various potential causes of this condition, including trauma, thyroid disease (specifically Graves' Disease), general connective tissue disorders, certain types of tumors or it could occur spontaneously. Since you mentioned your mother previously had thyroid problem and she has bulging eyes (a symptom of Graves' disease), there may be a connection here even though she hasn't shown signs of thyroid problems lately.\n\nTreatment typically aims at addressing the underlying cause. If Grave's disease is indeed the underlying reason, treating the thyroid disorder might also improve her eye condition over time. But in cases where globe luxation becomes recurrent, some surgical options exist to try to avoid future incidents.\n\nIt is important that she continues her appointments with her ophthalmologist, and perhaps consult an endocrinologist for her past thyroid issue too. The results from her medical tests will give more insights into the root causes of her condition.\n\nAlways remember to keep calm, do not attempt to replace the eye yourself as your father did, because any improper handling can lead to increased damage and pain. Instead, cover the eye with a wet cloth and rush her to the emergency department immediately.\n\n## Output (b):\n What would you like to ask the doctor?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Could you please see if the report is fine? Will I require a vaccination dose for the same (I had the vaccination in childhood)? Is it harmful to have the vaccination more than once?I had a rheumatic heart surgery four years ago (aortic valve replacement). Currently, I am on Betaloc 12.5 mg, Ecosprin 75 mg, and Warfarin 5 mg.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry, but as a text-based assistant, I am not able to view physical materials such as blood test reports. However, you can share with me the results if they are numerical or described in words, and I may be able to help interpret them.\n\nRegarding re-vaccination, it depends on your MMR titer levels, which measure your immunity towards measles, mumps, and rubella. If your titers indicate that you have low immunity, then revaccination may be recommended. \n\nAbout whether it's harmful to get an additional MMR shot when you're already immune: generally, it is considered safe. It doesn't boost your immunity further, but it usually doesn't harm you either, except for possible minor side effects similar to the initial vaccination like mild soreness at the injection site.\n\nHowever, because of your medical history (rheumatic heart surgery and a replaced aortic valve) and currently being on Warfarin, Betaloc, and Ecosprin, you should discuss this with your cardiologist before making any decisions. Different vaccines could potentially interact with these medications, or pose other risks considering your heart condition.\n\nPlease consult with your doctor who would give you precise advice based on thorough understanding of your medical history and current situation.\n\n## Output (b):\n What was the result?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

He snores every night and tosses and turns and has trouble breathing through his nose. His doctor says he has enlarged tonsils and adenoids. I think he has obstructed sleep apnea because I hear him gasping for air sometimes.We did a sleep study and the night of the sleep study he slept well. But every night at home he has a lot of trouble sleeping. He wakes up a lot, talks in his sleep has nightmares and I think he has sleep apnea because I hear him gasping for air sometimes.The doctor said we could try Flonaise to help him. But we read that Flonaise can stunt a child's growth. The doctor said he could grow into his tonsils. And I also heard that 2 years old is very young for tonsil surgery.My questions are how worried should I be about his troubled seeping? I am not getting any sleep lately because I listen to him all night. Is it dangerous to let him go on trying to sleep and have so much trouble breathing each night with possible sleep apnea? Please help. I am very concerned.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's understandable that you're concerned as your little one is experiencing disrupted sleep due to potentially obstructive sleep apnea. This condition isn't uncommon in kids, and it can certainly be aggravated by enlarged tonsils or adenoids, leading to symptoms like snoring, interrupted breathing during sleep or restlessness.\n\nThe results of the sleep study may have been influenced if he slept unusually well that night, which might not reflect his typical sleeping patterns. So, if his nightly symptoms continue, it may be necessary to conduct another sleep study to better understand and diagnose the situation. \n\nRegarding the use of Flonase (fluticasone nasal spray), the risk of stunting growth in children is a known potential side effect, but is generally associated with long-term usage and often weighed against the benefit achieved from relieving inflammation of the nasal passages. \n\nIt is indeed rare for a 2-year-old to undergo adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy; a wait-and-see approach is usually favored initially depending on the severity of the symptoms.

I got married five months back. Initially two months back, I was able to do intercourse well but now before the start of the intercourse, I am getting the ejaculation. We are planning for a child now but I am much worried. My height is 187 cm and weight is 102 kg.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nPremature ejaculation can be caused by a variety of factors, which could include psychological issues such as stress or performance anxiety, certain medications, or underlying medical conditions. However, it's also common for a sudden change in sexual performance to be temporary, and it may resolve on its own over time especially if this problem has appeared recently.\n\nHere are few suggestions that might help:\n1. Behavioral techniques: Some men find that practicing the \"start-stop\" technique or the \"squeeze\" technique helps them last longer. This involves stimulation until the man feels he is approaching climax, then stopping until the level of arousal decreases before restarting.\n2. Masturbating an hour or two before intercourse so that you might delay ejaculation during sex.\n3. Using thick condoms: These can reduce sensitivity and helps you last longer during sex.\n4. Couple therapy or counseling to address any relationship or anxiety issues.\n5. Pelvic Floor Exercises - Strengthening pelvic muscle using Kegel exercises has shown some benefit.\n\nIf there is no improvement with these efforts, please consult a urologist or a therapist specializing in sexual disorders to discuss further options, including possible medicinal therapies (like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors-SSRIs) or local anesthetic creams. Remember, you are not alone and premature ejaculation is a very common issue faced by many men at different points in their lives.\n\n## Output (b):\n I am a doctor.

She had a heavy cold and cough last week due to which she got a temperature of 99.8. So I gave her Calpol 250 next day morning similar range so I again continued the medicine and visited the doctor. He said continue fever doses irrespective of whether there is or not for three days post which the same day and next day she had no fever but again suddenly she got 99.5 and till night it went to 102.8 and did not reduce at all till we visited the doctor next day. He asked us to take blood urine reports are prescribed antibiotic Augmentin and continued to Calpol and SOS Meftal syrup as he sighted bacterial infection. Now she is taking antibiotic four doses plus Paracetomol but fever keeps coming back. So, by yesterday night gave her Meftal post which her fever came down. Should I continue Meftal syrup irrespective of fever level along with Calpol and antibiotic as to control the fever levels? I am worried why the fever keeps coming back the same level even though now four doses of antibiotic are completed.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like your daughter is fighting off an infection, hence the ongoing fevers even after treatment with antibiotics. Antibiotics usually take a few days to start working and it can sometimes take longer depending on the type of infection. It's important to follow the instructions given by your doctor regarding medication administration. Paracetamol (Calpol) and mefenamic acid (Meftal syrup) are typically used to manage fever.\n\nHowever, I would advise against administering Meftal irrespective of the fever level. Mefenamic acid should only be used if paracetamol isn't controlling the fever adequately, or in cases of high fever as per guidance from your healthcare provider.\n\nIf the fever persists for more than 5 days or any new symptoms arise, please contact your doctor again. Continue giving her plenty of fluids to keep her hydrated, and encourage rest. \n\nRemember this advice is based on the information you have provided and might not be entirely accurate.

And it ended a week later. Today (five days after it ended), I had some brown discharge (this was about 11 hours ago). And this is gonna sound really weird but when I was in the shower (11 hours later) I stuck my finger up there and when I pulled my finger out there was a lot of blood and discharge and it smells terrible. Is this normal to have this much discharge so close to my past period?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nDischarge can occur between periods and can be normal, depending on its consistency, color, volume, and smell. Small amounts of brown discharge can be considered normal as it's usually older blood that didn't get fully expelled during your period.\n\nHowever, large amounts of foul-smelling discharge are not common and can sometimes be a sign of certain conditions such as bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis, or other types of infection. The bloody discharge you're experiencing now could also indicate spotting or irregular bleeding.\n\nPlease reach out to a healthcare professional for an evaluation soon. They may recommend diagnostic tests to check for infections or any underlying gynecological conditions. While waiting for an appointment, try to avoid vaginal douching, sex, or inserting anything into the vagina to prevent further irritation or potential spread of infection. \n\nRemember this advice is based on the information provided and might not fully apply to your specific health situation.

Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nEmergency contraceptive pills such as Unwanted 72 can cause earlier or later menstrual periods depending on the time of intake. It's not uncommon to experience changes in period timing, duration, or volume after taking emergency contraceptives. Bleeding can occur within a week of pill intake and sometimes it might be heavier than usual.\n\nIf her bleeding is very heavy (soaking more than one sanitary pad per hour for several hours), if she has severe abdominal pain, or if there are any other concerns, you should seek medical attention immediately.

I am worried about any possible infection that could happen. I did a p24 antigen test. The results are p24 antigen on fourth day-0.125, sixth day-0.254, ninth day-0.271, twelfth day-0.274, fifteenth day-0.396, nineteenth day-0.540.I am upset about the increase in count. Please advise. I have done PCR RNA after 15 days for HIV 1, and it is not of detected status and HIV 2 ELISA on the nineteenth day which was also nonreactive. Kindly advise.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's very normal to feel worried after a potential exposure to HIV or any STI. In your case, you took the correct steps by using protection and getting tested afterwards.\n\nThere are a few important things to note regarding these tests:\n\n1. A p24 antigen test will detect the presence of the p24 protein which is associated with HIV. However, this initial increase could also be due to non-specific binding, directly following an acute infection. It's not clear if this increasing pattern is typical in early HIV infection since it varies person to person. \n\n2. PCR RNA tests for HIV 1 usually provide accurate results within 7-14 days post-exposure. If your test came back as not detected, this is a good sign that suggests you did not contract HIV 1 during this incident.\n\n3. An HIV 2 ELISA test can potentially give false negatives during the \"window period,\" which is up to 1-3 months after exposure. However, HIV 2 is much less common than HIV 1, especially outside of West Africa. The fact that your result was nonreactive is again a good sign.\n\nIn conclusion, while your results so far indicate you likely have not contracted either HIV 1 or 2, it would still be prudent to continue testing. Most testing protocols recommend follow up at 1 month, 3 months and possibly 6 months post-exposure. This gives enough time for antibodies to develop and be detected.

My height is 5.7 and wife is 5.1. I am extremely worried about my children height as we are short. My daughter is now 3 years 10 months old and have 14.5 kg weight and 38 inches tall. She had seizure thrice and taking some sodium liquid medicine for the past three years. My son is 1 year old and 10.2 kg weights and 28 inches tall. I want to know what would be the appropriate height of my children as per current status. Is there anything I can do to increase their height? I want my daughter to be 5.6 tall and son to be 6 ft tall. Will giving protein powder make any difference? Kindly do the needful.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHeight is primarily determined by genetics, although nutrition and overall health can play a role as well. Based on your heights, it's likely that your children will be somewhere in the same range when they're fully grown.\n\nRegarding your daughter\u2019s height at 3 years 10 months, she appears to be slightly above average for her age group according to standard growth charts. Your son seems to be within normal range for his age as well.\n\nAs for increasing their height, providing them with adequate nutrition is crucial. This includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins, and dairy products. Physical activity is also important as it helps promote bone health and growth. Avoid giving protein powder without specific medical advice, as excessive protein intake can potentially harm developing kidneys, particular in young children.\n\nGiven that your daughter has had seizures and is on medication, any changes to diet should be discussed with her treating physician \u2013 particularly if it involves supplements like protein powder. It's also essential to manage her seizures properly, as uncontrolled seizures can sometimes affect growth and development.\n\nAlso remember, while it's natural for parents to want the best for their kids, being overly concerned about physical attributes may cause unnecessary stress. Encourage your children to eat healthy, stay active, do well in school, and most importantly, be happy. Exceptional height or not, they are capable of leading successful lives.\n\nTo get more personalized guidance, you can also consult with a Pediatric Endocrinologist who specializes in child growth patterns.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer the questions below to help us diagnose your condition.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I recently went to my doctor because I lost some of my hearing, and I have been having pains in my right ear. My doctor told me that the ear drum healed but there is a lot of scarring on it. Why is my eardrum hurting if it is improved?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nScarring from your previous ruptured eardrum can cause some changes to the structure and function of your ear. This scarring may lead to reduced mobility or increased stiffness of the eardrum, which can impact how well it transmits sound, resulting in hearing loss.  \n\nThe pain you're experiencing could be due to a couple different factors, even after healing has occurred. One possibility is that stiffening from the scar tissue could make the drum more sensitive to pressure changes, causing discomfort or pain especially when there are changes in atmospheric pressure like during air travel, diving or sometimes even weather changes.\n\nAnother possibility is Eustachian Tube Dysfunction (ETD). The Eustachian tube helps regulate ear pressure. When functioning suboptimally\u2014whether due to inflammation, congestion, or physical blockages\u2014you might experience symptoms such as ongoing pain/pressure, fluid build-up, and decreased hearing.\n\nFinally, the presence of scar tissue does leave your eardrum somewhat vulnerable to infection because its barrier is tougher but less flexible than it was before the rupture. If you have associated symptoms like fever, dizziness, pus discharge etc., it might suggest an active infection. \n\nTo better understand why you're having these symptoms and to get proper treatment, I recommend visiting an ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist who can provide a thorough examination and management plan. They will rule out other causes as well such as otitis media, TMJ disorder etc. Remember, online advice cannot replace one-on\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your question.

One year ago, I was suffering from a hard stool that was difficult to pass. I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days. During this time, I was always sleepy. I took leave from work and was always tired and fatigued. Earlier this month, I went to another GI specialist who did a sigmoidoscopy and said that it is SRUS. He said that I should not finger evacuate the stools and gave me liquid paraffin and LoX cream. Now, my current situation is that it has been three days and I am very constipated and fatigued. The pain has subsided a little. However, I am not passing stools as I used to before. After I drink water or eat something, I get a vomiting sensation. I get anxiety and panic attacks as I am scared about my condition and do not know which doctor I should consult and what I should do. Is this condition serious and life-long? Will I ever be cured? Please advise on the correct medications (allopathy or ayurveda), lifestyle changes and other things to take care.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear that you've been dealing with this distressing situation. While I can't necessarily advise a specific treatment plan over the internet, I will tell you this: Chronic constipation can make an anal fissure, hemorrhoids, and Solitary Rectal ulcer Syndrome (SRUS) worse due to straining or hard stools. Conversely, these ailments can contribute to constipation as well.\n\nThe first thing is to ensure you're properly managing constipation by drinking ample amounts of water, eating high-fiber foods (such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits), regular exercise, and not delaying going to the bathroom when you feel the need. Stool softeners or fiber supplements may also be helpful in managing your symptoms. Over time, this approach should help soften the stool and decrease the need for straining, which might alleviate some of the discomfort from all three conditions. \n\nRegarding SRUS, it's indeed important to avoid digital defecation as it can exacerbate the ulcer. Using laxatives like liquid paraffin as prescribed by your doctor may aid with avoiding straining during defecation.\n\nIt's worth noting that achieving improvement with SRUS often takes time. Rest assured, while it may occasionally persist or recur, it's typically not life-threatening. It would help if you continue working with a GI specialist who has experience treating this condition - both for direct medical management and for reassurance and advice regarding any anxiety associated with your health issues.\n\nFeeling fatigued could\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for the details.

Should I cancel this procedure?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I would like to reassure you that Fentanyl and Versed are commonly used medications in anesthesia. While Suboxone (buprenorphine) is an opioid medication which can potentially interact with other opioids such as fentanyl, your healthcare team is fully aware of this and would monitor and manage the situation appropriately.\n\nIn terms of drug-drug interaction, using fentanyl with buprenorphine may decrease the effect of fentanyl. But because of individual differences in reactions to medicine, it doesn't necessarily mean you'd end up in withdrawal. The anesthesiologist who's providing sedation will adjust the dosage accordingly by observing your vital signs and level of comfort.\n\nThere's always some risk associated with combining drugs, especially central nervous system depressants. However, these combinations are sometimes necessary for medical procedures. Anesthesia providers are specifically trained to manage these situations safely.\n\nI strongly advise you not to cancel the procedure based only on internet advice or indirect information from non-anesthesia staff. Instead, request a consultation with your anesthesiologist so he/she can answer all your questions directly and address your concerns more comprehensively. This way, they can create the safest possible plan for your procedure. Remember, your anesthesiologist\u2019s main job is not just to sedate you but ensures safety before, during and after any procedure.\n\nJust make certain that your health care team, including the anesthesiologist, knows about all the prescription and over-the-counter medications you take\n\n## Output (b):\n All right, Doctor.

Again, I had sex in a gap of three days after the intake of tablet. I am really worried if I should take the pill again. This was a terrible mistake. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nEmergency contraceptives like the I-pill can help prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. However, they are not designed to be regular forms for contraception and their effectiveness diminishes with repeated use in a single cycle.\n\nSince you have had unprotected sex again after taking the I-pill, technically there is a risk of pregnancy as sperm can live inside the body for up to 5 days. It sounds like you are in a possible fertile window given the timing in your cycle. \n\nWhile another emergency pill may reduce the risk further, it's probably wise to talk this through with a healthcare professional to discuss other ways of preventing unintended pregnancies and protecting against sexually transmitted infections, which emergency contraception does not cover. They could also carry out a pregnancy test or potentially prescribe a more suitable form of contraception for future. Over-use of such pills might lead to hormonal imbalance leading to irregular menses so please consult with a healthcare provider before use.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is everything alright?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My height is 167 cm and weight is 53 kg. I have had headaches and pain in the eyes for the last two days. My nose has been blocked for about a week now and every time I blow my nose, my head hurts a lot. It also hurts when I shake my head.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHello, based on your symptoms, it seems you may be experiencing a sinus infection or sinusitis. This condition is often caused by a viral or sometimes bacterial infection and results in inflammation and swelling of the sinuses. This can cause pain in your head, eyes, and pressure around your nose. It also explains the blocked nose. The heightened pain when blowing your nose or shaking your head is due to this pressure and inflammation.\n\nYou should rest, stay hydrated, and use over-the-counter pain relief if needed. Nasal sprays might help to relieve some congestion. Warm compresses applied to your face could also provide some relief from the pain.\n\nHowever, if your symptoms persist more than about a week or get worse, you should seek medical attention. In some cases, antibiotics may be necessary to clear up a bacterial sinus infection.

In the allopathic approach, the hormone needs to be taken for the rest of one\\s life and I am a bit scared of it. It is possible I may also be diabetic and will need to treat this as well. Can these conditions be successfully dealt with through ayurvedic treatments alone?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I would advise you that Ayurveda may help manage the symptoms of hypothyroidism to an extent but cannot completely cure this condition. Hypothyroidism is a result of reduced thyroid hormone production, and in most cases, patients need hormonally based medication as a supplement. Ayurvedic treatments, lifestyle changes, dietary habits, and certain yoga poses might assist in managing the signs and symptoms better.\n\nRegarding your potential diabetes, again it's important to understand that while Ayurvedic medicine can certainly be utilized as part of effective management strategies for these conditions, they are not considered definitive cures.\n\nYou may see some positive impact from Ayurvedic medicine and diet modifications, though consistent monitoring and treatment under your healthcare provider will still be necessary. These suggestions should never replace regular check-ups and tests to monitor your hormone levels or blood sugar levels.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider, so they can provide you with the best possible advice suited to your specific situation.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you a doctor?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

On the 2nd, my girlfriend started her period. It is now the 16th. So, I believe she is in her ovulation phase. Since her period stopped, she has begun, for the very first time, taking the combined contraceptive pill consistently at 8 AM every morning. She took the pill yesterday morning. Last night, on the 15th of March, we had unprotected sex (we thought one night without condoms would be fine). However, this morning she was in a rush and forgot to take her pill for today. It is 2:16 PM now and I have a few urgent questions:Should she take the morning after pill?How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today?Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk?Should we be worried?Thank you.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIf your girlfriend has been consistently taking the combined contraceptive pill for more than 7 days before missing a dose, she is likely to be protected against pregnancy. The efficiency of the contraceptive pill tends to build up over time and it becomes highly effective after taking it continuously for seven days.\n\nHere are the answers to your questions:\n\n1. Taking the morning-after pill could provide an extra safety layer but isn't generally required if only one combined pill was missed and all other pills were taken correctly.\n\n2. The morning-after pill can reduce the risk of pregnancy by 75-89% if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, depending on the exact type used.\n\n3. The previously taken contraceptive pills would have likely decreased her chances of ovulation thus lowering the chance of pregnancy somewhat, however there is still a risk especially given she may be in her fertile period.\n\n4. If she is indeed in her fertile period (usually around day 14), missing a combination birth control pill can lead to a higher risk of pregnancy because of potential ovulation, especially if associated with unprotected sex.\n\n5. Even if she takes the morning-after pill, she should also take today's missed pill as soon as she remembers and continue the rest of her pack as normal.\n\n6. Apart from taking the morning-after pill and continuing her regular combined contraceptive pill, there aren't many options to reduce the risk further at this point.\n\n7. Although there may be some level of concern due to the missed-pill and the timing of\n\n## Output (b):\n Was your girlfriend using the pill before?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}
