It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information based on your description. It is possible that the infection in your left testicle is related to the mumps infection you had five months ago. However, without a proper examination and medical history review by a healthcare professional, it would be difficult to determine the exact cause of your symptoms. \n\nIf you are still experiencing pain and swelling in your testicle, it is important to have a follow-up evaluation with a doctor. They will be able to perform a physical examination, ask further questions about your symptoms, and possibly order additional tests such as blood work or imaging studies to help diagnose the underlying cause.\n\nAs for antibiotic recommendations, only a doctor can prescribe antibiotics after evaluating your condition. Taking an antibiotic without proper diagnosis and prescription may not be effective and could potentially contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Have you experienced any of the following symptoms associated with cocaine use? Please select all that apply.\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm sorry to hear about your situation. As an AI language model, I can provide some general information, but it's important to note that I am not a doctor. If you have concerns or questions about drug use and its impact on fertility, I strongly recommend consulting with a healthcare professional.\n\nCocaine is a powerful stimulant drug that can have detrimental effects on both male and female fertility. Cocaine use may affect sperm quality, including motility (movement) and morphology (shape), which could potentially reduce fertility. Additionally, cocaine use during pregnancy can pose serious risks to the developing fetus.\n\nThe exact time it takes for cocaine to completely leave the body varies depending on several factors, including the individual's metabolism, frequency of use, amount used, and overall health. Generally, cocaine is rapidly metabolized by the body, and its main metabolite, called benzoylecgonine, can be detected in urine for up to 2-4 days after use. However, traces of cocaine may be detectable in hair follicles for months to years.\n\nRegarding the presence of cocaine in sperm, limited research suggests that it may persist for up to three days after use but becomes undetectable within a week. It's important to remember that even if the direct presence of cocaine were no longer detectable, there could still be potential effects on sperm quality and fertility.\n\nTo ensure a safe and healthy environment for conception, it is generally recommended to discontinue drug use altogether, including cocaine.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Has there been any changes to the patient's condition?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information. Breakthrough bleeding or spotting can occur when you skip the sugar pills and continue taking active hormonal pills for an extended period of time. By doing this, your uterine lining may become unstable, leading to irregular bleeding.\n\nThe brown discharge you are experiencing could be residual blood from your recent period or breakthrough bleeding. It is not uncommon for some women to have brown discharge for a few days up to a week after their period ends. If you recently had sex and experienced bleeding, it could have caused some minor trauma to the cervix or vaginal tissue, resulting in additional bleeding or spotting. \n\nHowever, any persistent or heavy bleeding, significant pain, or other abnormal symptoms should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. If you're concerned or if the bleeding continues beyond a week, it is recommended to reach out to your doctor or gynecologist for further evaluation and guidance. They will be able to provide a more accurate assessment, considering your specific medical history and circumstances.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Thank you for your information. I will be sure to pass this on to the doctor. Is there anything else you would like to inform me of?\n\n## Output (b):\nI am not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information that may help. It is common to experience swelling and discomfort after wisdom tooth removal surgery, especially within the first week. The hard lump you are feeling could potentially be due to post-operative swelling or inflammation in the area. It's also possible that it could be a blood clot forming as part of the healing process.\n\nHowever, since you mentioned that the tooth on the lower side was pulled without removing the root due to its proximity to the nerve, it would be best to consult your oral surgeon or dentist for an evaluation. They will have the most accurate understanding of your specific case and can examine the lump to determine if any further treatment is necessary.\n\nIn the meantime, continue taking your prescribed medications as directed by your healthcare provider, and follow any post-operative care instructions they provided. This generally includes practicing good oral hygiene, using saltwater rinses, avoiding excessive physical activity, and consuming soft foods.\n\nAgain, it's important to reach out to your oral surgeon or dentist for proper evaluation and advice regarding the lump and any persistent soreness you are experiencing.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I got it tested many times in those three months and got a negative result. I am worrying abt six months test.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nDo you have any symptoms now other than red dots in your finger?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information. It is normal to be concerned about potential exposure to HIV after engaging in unprotected sex.

It would be best to consult with a healthcare professional, who can evaluate your symptoms and provide an accurate diagnosis.\n\nRegarding HIV testing, it is recommended to get tested at least 3 months after a potential exposure. Some testing centers may also recommend follow-up testing at 6 months. While testing multiple times within the 3-month period and receiving negative results can offer some reassurance, it is still advisable to complete the full testing timeline recommended by healthcare professionals. They can provide specific guidance based on your situation.\n\nRemember, only a qualified healthcare professional can provide a definitive diagnosis and appropriate advice.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did you do any research into your symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can help provide some general information based on your description. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment and personalized advice.\n\nBased on the information you provided, it seems like you have two small nodules in your lungs, with one being 3 mm in the right lower lobe (RLL) and another being 4 mm in the left lower lobe (LLL), which is described as an intrapulmonary lymph node. The report also mentions no suspicious lung lesions or enlarged lymph nodes. Additionally, mild thymic hyperplasia was noted, which refers to an enlargement of the thymus gland.\n\nIt's important to note that without a complete evaluation of your medical history and a physical examination, it's difficult to give specific recommendations. However, in many cases, small nodules found incidentally on CT scans are benign and do not require any treatment or intervention. Often, follow-up imaging after a certain period of time may be recommended to monitor for any changes in size or appearance. This approach is taken because many small nodules are harmless and can resolve on their own, while others may remain stable over time.\n\nYour healthcare provider will consider factors such as the size, location, and appearance of the nodules, as well as your overall health, smoking history, and other risk factors when determining the appropriate course of action. They may recommend follow-up imaging at a specified interval, such as one year, to assess if\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

My last ferritin level was 342, 20 days back. My ferritin level has been as high as 390. My TIBC, UIBC, iron, and iron saturation have always been within normal range. My glucose has always ranged from 100 to 104. I was tested for hemochromatosis and results are negative. My doctors keep telling me that we will just watch my ferritin level and I have bloodwork done every six months. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year. I am looking for some answers and some help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What about your family?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some information based on your description. An elevated ferritin level can be concerning as it is typically an indicator of excess iron storage in the body. However, since your other iron-related markers (TIBC, UIBC, iron, and iron saturation) are within normal range, it suggests that hemochromatosis is unlikely to be the cause.\n\nThere are several other possible causes for elevated ferritin levels, including chronic inflammation, liver disease, certain types of anemia, and metabolic syndrome. Given that you have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, it's important to note that chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia can also lead to increased ferritin levels due to ongoing inflammation.\n\nIt's good that you're getting regular bloodwork done to monitor your ferritin levels. If your doctors have ruled out hemochromatosis and continue to observe your levels without further intervention, it could indicate that there is no immediate concern regarding your ferritin levels.\n\nHowever, if you have ongoing symptoms or concerns, it's important to discuss them with your healthcare provider. They may consider further investigations or refer you to a specialist who can assess your overall health and provide more targeted advice. It might also be worth discussing your fibromyalgia diagnosis and exploring potential treatment options or management strategies specific to your condition.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n It might be best to start with a general question.\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm sorry to hear about your ongoing concerns with a fishy odor and possible bacterial vaginosis. I'll do my best to provide some information and suggestions, but please remember that it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and personalized advice.\n\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection caused by an imbalance in the bacteria normally present in the vagina. Typically, it is characterized by symptoms such as a strong, fishy odor, thin grayish-white discharge, and sometimes itching or burning sensation.\n\nUntreated BV can potentially lead to complications like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can increase the risk of infertility. However, it's important to note that not all cases of BV will necessarily progress to infertility. The chances of this happening vary depending on individual factors and how long the infection remains untreated.\n\nRegarding tips and suggestions, here are a few:\n\n1. Consult with a healthcare provider: It's essential to see a doctor or gynecologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. They may recommend further tests or examinations to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\n\n2. Consider a second opinion: If you were unsatisfied with the outcomes of your previous treatment, seeking another healthcare professional's opinion might be beneficial. They may offer alternative medications or therapies based on your specific situation.\n\n3. Practice good hygiene: Keep the genital area clean and dry, using mild, non-irritating soap for cleansing.

Initially, it used to happen only in winter 4 to 5 years back and then gradually started in rainy days also. Now in summer also while sweating. It is so irritating like that I am going to be mad. I have stopped using soap and also took Clonafit 0.25 mg and Betonix- 10 prescribed by a dermatologist but there is no improvement. Please help me out of this.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Please specify the following about the patient's symptoms:\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but it sounds like you may be experiencing an allergic reaction or sensitivity to something in your environment. It could be related to certain chemicals or substances that come into contact with your skin during bathing or sweating.

They can perform tests to identify potential allergens or irritants that may be causing your itching. They may also prescribe alternative medications or suggest other treatment options based on their evaluation.\n\nIn the meantime, it might be helpful to try using hypoallergenic products for bathing and moisturizing, and avoiding any known triggers such as particular fabrics or harsh detergents.

I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of related to this issue?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but based on the symptoms you described, it's possible that your facial tightness and burning sensations in your chest could be related to anxiety. It's important to note that anxiety can manifest differently in each individual, and it can sometimes cause physical symptoms as well.\n\nSince you have already visited medical specialists and undergone tests that have ruled out any underlying medical conditions, it may be worth considering seeking a second opinion or discussing these ongoing symptoms with your primary care physician. They can evaluate your overall health, review your test results, and provide further guidance on managing your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, you might find it helpful to explore stress-reduction techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, regular exercise, and maintaining a balanced lifestyle with healthy eating habits. Additionally, consider finding ways to manage stress and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist who can help you cope with anxiety if necessary.\n\nRemember, this response is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

She had been treated for TB (tuberculosis) of the abdomen as her ultrasound of abdomen finding was thicken bowel loop. In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition. But, her neuro problem of numbness in her legs and loss of sensation in legs still continues. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did you also see a dermatologist?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to help provide some information based on the description you've provided.\n\nIt seems that your mother experienced peripheral neuropathy, which is nerve damage affecting the legs and feet. This condition might have been caused by an overdose of TB medication, as well as compression of her spine due to a fall. The subsequent treatments she received did not appear to improve her symptoms and may have worsened her condition.\n\nThe fact that her condition deteriorated during steroid treatment suggests that she may have had a negative reaction to the medication. Steroids can sometimes worsen infections or other underlying conditions. It's good that the steroids were withdrawn once she showed severe breathlessness and high blood sugar levels.\n\nAt this point, it seems appropriate for her to seek advice from the department of immunology since her condition has not improved with previous treatments. They may be able to investigate if her immune system is involved in her symptoms and can provide alternative treatment options.\n\nIt's important for your mother to continue consulting with healthcare professionals who specialize in the areas of neurology, immunology, and rheumatology. They will be able to further evaluate her condition and recommend appropriate management strategies.\n\nPlease note that I am an AI language model and cannot provide a definitive diagnosis.

I am taking Afrin spray for an hour and one pill of Sudafed. I developed a similar condition of cold and sinus infection before six months. I had severe clogging of ears. I was given Amoxicillin for five days and Prednisone 5 mg. My ENT doctor examined my ears and told me that there was no issue with the eardrum. He diagnosed it as eustachian tube issue. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What are your symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information based on your description. It sounds like you may be experiencing a recurrence of your cold and sinus infection, which is causing the severe clogging in your ears.

If your wife suspects she may be pregnant and wants to explore options such as medication-induced abortion, it is important for her to seek medical advice from a healthcare professional.\n\nMifepristone is indeed a medication that can be used to induce abortion, typically in combination with another medication called misoprostol. However, the use of this medication should only be done under the guidance and supervision of a qualified healthcare provider.\n\nWhile mifepristone is generally considered safe, there can be potential side effects and risks associated with its use.

My mother is 50 years old. She complains of episodic, sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon. This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother. She has a history of menorrhagia and cycles have become more irregular now. Then, diagnostic D and C was performed last year, which was normal. She will not smoke or drink. She sleeps 4 to 6 hours daily and snores at night.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Does your mother have any other medical conditions?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but based on the description provided, it is important for your mother to consult with a healthcare professional to evaluate her symptoms.

Falls and Trauma: The falls may have resulted from the sudden inability to bear weight on the affected tendon. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of these episodes.\n\n3. Knee Pain: Bilateral knee pain attributed to osteoarthritis is common in individuals over 50 years old and may contribute to difficulties in mobility and balance.\n\n4. Hip Pain and Swelling: The hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing and changing positions could be due to various causes such as inflammation, bursitis, or degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis). Further examination is required to determine the underlying cause.\n\n5. Shoulder Stiffness: Episodic stiffness in the shoulders that limits raising arms above shoulder level may be caused by conditions like frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) or rotator cuff problems.

Soon into using the drugs I developed headaches, dizziness, and nausea. I changed the type of PPI three times but the symptoms persisted. The symptoms included a feeling of pressure above my right ear and behind my right eye. Later, I came off the PPIs and after using over the counter headache painkillers for three days the severity of the headaches eased. But the feeling of pressure remains to this day on the right side of the face. I often feel heavy head or even light-headed with a slight dizziness, often as if I am hung over. The symptoms come and go, but are there every day for differing periods of time. And the constant is this feeling of slight pressure on the right side of my head above the ear and extending sometimes down to the cheek and behind the right eye.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n In the past, have you had any medical conditions or operations? Have you had any previous treatments?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but based on the symptoms you've described, it's possible that you may be experiencing tension headaches or migraines. The fact that your symptoms improve when using over-the-counter painkillers suggests that these headaches might be responsive to medication.\n\nHowever, since you mentioned experiencing dizziness and nausea as well, it would be advisable to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation. There are various causes of headaches and associated symptoms, including sinus problems, TMJ (temporomandibular joint) dysfunction, or even neurological conditions. A doctor will be able to take a detailed medical history, perform a physical examination, and possibly order additional tests to help diagnose the underlying cause accurately.\n\nIt's important to communicate all your symptoms and concerns with your doctor, as they can provide the most appropriate advice and treatment options based on their evaluation.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Trench mouth, also known as acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), is typically characterized by painful gums with ulceration and inflammation. It is often associated with bad breath, metallic taste in the mouth, and difficulty in eating or swallowing.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that I cannot diagnose your partner based on a description alone. If you are concerned about their oral health, it would be best for them to see a dentist or healthcare professional who can evaluate their symptoms properly.

They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22. So everyone on my side of the family has thyroid issues. We were wondering if you could please give us some guidance. Looking to see if we need to eliminate thyroid as a possible cause of his symptoms or if it is worth further pursuit.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of about your son's condition?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to help provide some general information based on the description you provided. It's understandable that your son's symptoms and family history would raise concerns about thyroid issues. However, it's important to note that I am an AI language model and cannot diagnose or provide specific medical advice.\n\nGiven your son's anxiety symptoms and negative test results for thyroid function, it may be worth considering that his symptoms are related to anxiety rather than solely a thyroid disorder. Anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as heart palpitations, sweating, and lightheadedness.\n\nLow iodine levels in urine could indicate a potential deficiency, which may affect thyroid function. However, it's important to note that iodine deficiencies are relatively uncommon in developed countries where salt is typically iodized. If you suspect a dietary issue, ensuring that your son has a balanced diet with adequate sources of iodine (such as seafood or iodized salt) might be beneficial. However, supplementation should only be considered under the guidance of a healthcare professional.\n\nConsidering your family history of thyroid disorders, it may be worthwhile discussing these concerns with an endocrinologist to evaluate if further exploration or testing is necessary. They will be able to assess your son's medical history, symptoms, and perform a comprehensive examination to determine the appropriate course of action.\n\nGiven your son's fear of doctors causing severe panic, it may also be helpful to work with a mental health professional who specializes in anxiety disorders.

Please complete the questionnaire to the best of your knowledge.\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information. Masturbation does not directly cause acne or pimples. Acne is typically caused by hormonal changes, excess oil production, bacteria, and clogged pores.\n\nAs for the use of Mometasone, it is a topical corticosteroid that is often used to reduce inflammation, itching, and swelling associated with certain skin conditions. However, it is not commonly prescribed for treating acne. Long-term use of topical steroids like Mometasone on the face can have potential side effects, such as thinning of the skin, discoloration, and increased risk of infections.\n\nIf you're experiencing acne, it would be best to consult with a dermatologist who can evaluate your specific condition and recommend appropriate treatment options.

Is that something cancerous?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n If you are a doctor, please provide a diagnosis.\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm an AI language model, not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information. A soft pulpy lump in the shoulder could have several possible causes. While cancer is one possibility, it's important to keep in mind that there are also many non-cancerous causes for such lumps.\n\nSome non-cancerous causes of lumps in the shoulder include lipomas (benign fatty tumors), ganglion cysts (fluid-filled cysts), or other benign growths. Pain or discomfort associated with these types of lumps can be related to their size, location, or pressure on surrounding structures.\n\nTo determine the cause of the lump accurately, your mother should consult a healthcare professional.

It's important to note that I am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information.\n\nThe discoloration you described could potentially be due to several factors, including poor oral hygiene, dental decay, or certain dietary habits. The bad smell may also indicate the presence of bacteria and plaque in your mouth.\n\nHere are some suggestions that may help:\n\n1. Improve your oral hygiene routine: Make sure you brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste, especially after meals. Don't forget to floss daily as well, as it helps remove plaque between teeth.\n2. Visit a dentist: Schedule an appointment with a dentist for a thorough examination and professional cleaning. They will be able to determine the cause of the discoloration and advise you on appropriate treatment options.\n3. Limit foods and drinks that stain your teeth: Some common culprits include coffee, tea, red wine, and highly pigmented foods like berries. If you consume these items, consider rinsing your mouth with water afterward or using a straw to minimize contact with your teeth.\n4. Avoid tobacco products: Smoking and chewing tobacco can contribute to tooth discoloration and bad breath.\n5.

As an AI language model, I am unable to view any attached images or prescriptions. However, based on the information provided, there are a few possibilities for the cause of the rash:\n\n1. Viral Rash: If your son had a fever and the rash appeared around the same time, it is possible that it could be a viral rash. Many viral infections can cause a transient rash that typically resolves on its own without treatment.\n\n2. Allergic Reaction: Another possibility is an allergic reaction to something he came into contact with. This could include certain foods, medications, soaps, detergents, or even insect bites.\n\n3. Eczema: Chronic conditions such as eczema can present as recurring rashes that worsen in the evenings. It is common for children to develop eczema at a young age.\n\nIt would be best to consult with a dermatologist who can evaluate your son's condition in person, examine the rashes, and provide a proper diagnosis. They may also request additional tests if needed. In the meantime, you can try to keep your son's skin moisturized and avoid any potential irritants or allergens that could worsen the rash.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

The X-ray shows I have an intraarticular fracture of the right fifth metacarpal with significant ulnar displacement for consideration of ORIF. I went to my local hospital and they did a CT Scan. They sent me home and said to wait for their call to be seen at the Fracture Clinic. I have only buddy taping on my little and next finger. People are telling me it should be strapped or cast right away. I am worried.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Do you have a fracture?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. An intraarticular fracture of the fifth metacarpal with significant ulnar displacement typically refers to a broken bone in the hand (specifically the little finger) that extends into the joint space. ORIF stands for open reduction and internal fixation, which is a surgical procedure to realign the bones and stabilize them using plates, screws, or other hardware.\n\nThe decision to immobilize your hand with buddy taping instead of applying a cast or splint right away could depend on factors such as the severity and stability of the fracture, the presence of any additional injuries, and the expertise and judgment of the healthcare professionals involved. Buddy taping involves securing the injured finger to an adjacent finger using tape as a temporary means of stabilization. It is commonly used for milder fractures or while waiting for definitive treatment.\n\nHowever, without examining you or reviewing your specific imaging results, it's difficult to provide comprehensive advice. If you are concerned about the initial management plan or have questions about the next steps, it's best to reach out to your local hospital's Fracture Clinic for clarification.

Implantation bleeding, for example, can occur when a fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining, typically around 6-12 days after conception. This bleeding is usually light and short-lived.\n\nHowever, if your fiancee suspects she might be pregnant or if her periods are irregular or absent, it's essential for her to take a pregnancy test to confirm or rule out pregnancy as a possible cause for the spotting or absence of menstrual bleeding. She could consult with a healthcare professional who can perform appropriate tests and provide further guidance.\n\nRegarding dengue, it typically presents with symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, rash, and sometimes bleeding issues. Spotting is not generally considered a common symptom of dengue alone. However, any changes in menstrual patterns or unexpected bleeding should still be discussed with a doctor to evaluate potential underlying causes.\n\nOnce again, it is strongly recommended to speak with a healthcare provider to discuss your fiancee's specific situation and get accurate medical advice tailored to her needs.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

It is only noticeable when I close my left eye, and so I am not sure how long it has taken for this to develop. I am going to see an optometrist and doctor early next week but am currently on the road for work.My main question is that when I look out of the corner of my right eye the blurriness seems to subside and I can see usually. I am wondering if this is a good sign. I have been dealing with severe anxiety the past couple months, and I am worried that might have raised my blood pressure enough to hurt my eyesight.Eyesight when looking with both eyes seems to be normal. I have also noticed floaters in my eyes. Kindly help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is it painful?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some possibilities based on your description. Blurriness in one eye could be caused by various factors, including refractive errors (such as nearsightedness or astigmatism), dry eyes, eye muscle problems, or even certain conditions affecting the retina or optic nerve. Seeing floaters is relatively common and can be caused by age-related changes in the vitreous gel inside the eye or occasionally by more serious issues like retinal detachment.\n\nThe fact that your blurriness subsides when looking out of the corner of your right eye may suggest that it could be related to a localized issue, such as a problem with the cornea or lens. It's important to consult with an optometrist or ophthalmologist for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They will be able to conduct a comprehensive eye exam to determine the cause and appropriate treatment for your symptoms. Additionally, they can assess whether your severe anxiety or high blood pressure might be contributing factors.\n\nIn the meantime, you could continue to monitor your symptoms and make sure to rest your eyes regularly, especially if you spend a lot of time focusing on screens or doing detailed work. Avoiding excessive strain on your eyes may help prevent further discomfort or worsening of symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I have a sufficient space for it to grow, and it is growing straight. I do not have pain in the tooth and half of the tooth is poking out now. But I have trouble in opening my mouth fully.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Please note that the patient has answered the following questions:\n\n## Output (b):\nBased on your description, it seems like you may be experiencing a condition called trismus, which is difficulty in fully opening the mouth. Trismus can occur due to an infection or inflammation in the area of the wisdom tooth. It is possible that although your wisdom tooth is growing straight and not causing pain, it may still be causing some inflammation or irritation in the surrounding tissues.\n\nI would recommend visiting a dentist or oral surgeon for further evaluation. They will be able to examine your mouth and take appropriate imaging, such as an X-ray, to assess the cause of your restricted jaw movement. Treatment options may include antibiotics if there is an underlying infection, or extraction of the wisdom tooth if it is determined to be the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try using warm saltwater rinses several times a day to help reduce any swelling or inflammation. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, may also provide temporary relief from discomfort. Be sure to follow good oral hygiene practices by brushing and flossing properly, and avoid chewing on that side of your mouth until you have been evaluated by a professional.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I had two I-pills in one month. After the first I-pill, I got withdrawal bleeding after five days. It lasted for four days and the flow was normal. After 14 days of this incident, I again had protected sexual intercourse and took another I-pill after 36 hours. But this time even after 11 days, there is no withdrawal bleeding. Is this because of hormonal imbalance or pregnancy?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What is your answer?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you with your question. \n\nEmergency contraception pills, such as the I-pill, can cause changes in your menstrual cycle and hormonal balance. It's possible that the lack of withdrawal bleeding after the second pill is due to this hormonal imbalance. However, it's also important to consider other factors that could affect your menstrual cycle, such as stress or other underlying health conditions.\n\nIf you are concerned about the possibility of pregnancy, the best way to determine if you are pregnant is to take a home pregnancy test. These tests can usually detect pregnancy hormones in your urine around the time of your missed period. Consulting with a healthcare professional would also be beneficial to discuss your concerns and evaluate your specific situation further.\n\nRemember, emergency contraception methods are meant for occasional use and should not be relied upon as a regular form of birth control. If you are sexually active and wish to prevent pregnancy, speaking with a healthcare professional about different contraceptive options available to you would be recommended.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

It's important to consider a few factors when deciding whether to wait for your scheduled gynecologist appointment or go to an urgent care center:\n\n1.

I visited my family doctor and he told me to get a blood test and he also gave me a Cetirizine (Zyrtec) prescription which is 20 mg.

Chronic urticaria, which is characterized by the development of hives lasting for more than six weeks, can be a frustrating condition to manage.

However, in many cases, the cause of chronic urticaria remains unknown. The treatment approach usually involves managing the symptoms and providing relief.\n\nCetirizine (Zyrtec) is an antihistamine commonly used to alleviate the itching and rash associated with hives. However, it might not work effectively for everyone. If you've been taking Cetirizine for four days without experiencing significant improvement, it would be advisable to consult your doctor again. They may consider adjusting the dosage or trying a different antihistamine medication. In some cases, additional medications like H2 blockers or oral corticosteroids could be prescribed.\n\nYour doctor will be able to evaluate your specific case, take into consideration any additional factors or possible triggers, review your blood test results, and determine the most appropriate treatment plan for you.

Hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac around the testicle. It is usually benign and often causes no symptoms or complications. However, if the hydrocele is causing discomfort or if it has significantly increased in size, surgery may be recommended to remove or drain the fluid.\n\nThere are no reliable non-surgical methods to completely eliminate a hydrocele. Some people try home remedies such as wearing supportive underwear or applying cold compresses, but these methods generally only offer temporary relief and do not address the underlying issue.\n\nGoing to the gym and engaging in physical exercise should not cause any direct harm or worsen your hydrocele. In fact, regular exercise can have many health benefits. However, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional who specializes in urology to get personalized advice based on your specific condition.\n\nIf you're considering surgery, it's important to consult with a urologist who can evaluate your hydrocele, discuss the surgical options available, and guide you through the decision-making process.

Would you like to schedule an appointment or have a video consultation?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you with some general information. If you have recently had protected sex and are experiencing inflammation in your urinary tract, it could potentially be a sign of an infection. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for an evaluation and proper diagnosis.\n\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs) can occur after sexual activity due to the close proximity of the urethra to the genital area. Common symptoms of a UTI include frequent urination, a burning sensation while urinating, cloudy or bloody urine, and lower abdominal pain.\n\nIf left untreated, UTIs can progress and cause more serious complications, such as kidney infections. Therefore, it's best to seek medical attention promptly so that appropriate treatment, typically involving antibiotics, can be initiated if necessary.\n\nRemember, only a qualified healthcare professional who can examine you and gather all relevant details is able to provide an accurate diagnosis and appropriate advice.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

He has nasal blockage for the past two weeks. Now, he has developed a fever. His throat and tonsils are swollen. We took him to a doctor. The doctor prescribed him Benadryl 5 ml and Crocin DS 7.5 ml. He has not given any antibiotics. Is it fine? Please suggest.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Was your son recently exposed to any cold or allergy?\n\n## Output (b):\nI am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information. Nasal congestion and swollen throat and tonsils are commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold or viral pharyngitis. Since your son has developed a fever along with these symptoms, it may indicate a more severe infection.\n\nThe prescription of Benadryl (an antihistamine) may provide temporary relief for nasal congestion, while Crocin DS (a paracetamol-based medicine) can help reduce his fever. These medications aim to alleviate symptoms rather than directly treat the underlying cause, which is often viral in nature.\n\nAntibiotics are usually prescribed if there are signs of a bacterial infection, such as a persistent high fever, pus on the tonsils, or other specific criteria. It is possible that the doctor did not find sufficient evidence to suggest a bacterial infection, thus avoiding antibiotic use.\n\nHowever, if your son's symptoms worsen or persist beyond a few days, it would be advisable to revisit the doctor for reassessment. They will evaluate if additional treatment or investigation is necessary to address any potential bacterial infection or complications.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

My right hand and right shoulder directly hit the road and cause severe pain on the right side of the abdomen. A local doctor prescribed some medicine and I got relieved from my side pain. I went for an x-ray of the right chest, it was normal. But after 36 hours I am having pain in the right shoulder (scapula) and while sitting, or arising out of bed, or moving hand on the upper side the pain increases a lot. Is it normal or need better medical assistance?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Doctor, please confirm the patient's gender\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you with some general information. It is not uncommon for pain to develop or worsen in the shoulder after an injury like falling from a bike. The initial relief may have been due to the medication prescribed by the local doctor, but it's possible that the underlying cause of the pain was not completely resolved.\n\nSince your pain has persisted and is worsening with certain movements, it would be advisable to seek further medical assistance.

This month: BG 110 mg/dl, GTT one hour 184 mg/dl, two hours 115 mg/dl, morning insulin 5.3 \\xce\\xbcU/ml. Every other blood test within normal ranges. I am male 32 years old 1.86 cm 93 kg 13 to 14 % body fat athletic with healthy nutrition habits. No history of diabetes in the family. Could I be having cancer in pancreas judging from the insulin values you are seeing? I have had many years to do a blood test and with this random one seven months ago. I was told by my doctor that I had to keep monitoring my blood glucose since I could develop diabetes later on, and since I have never had a problem with blood sugar as a kid and no family history of diabetes, I was wondering what might be going on cause insulin levels dropped from my last test and since my diet was pretty much same with healthy choices why is this happening. My doctor for the last seven months kept telling me to calm down and that I do not have anything cause stressing is bad for my blood glucose too. Should I be telling him to get a pancreas MRI done?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm an AI language model, not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information based on your description. It's important to note that this should not be taken as medical advice.\n\nBased on the information you provided, it does not seem likely that you have pancreatic cancer solely based on your insulin levels. Insulin levels can vary depending on several factors, including meal size and composition, physical activity, stress level, and other hormonal influences. Fluctuations in insulin levels are generally considered within the normal range, especially if they are not accompanied by any other concerning symptoms or abnormalities.\n\nIt's encouraging that your blood glucose levels have been mostly within normal ranges, and without a family history of diabetes, it may be wise to continue monitoring your blood glucose periodically as advised by your doctor. Lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, play a significant role in managing blood glucose levels, so maintaining healthy habits is essential.\n\nIf you have persistent concerns about your pancreas or want further evaluation, it is best to discuss them with your healthcare provider. They can assess your overall clinical picture, order additional tests or referrals if necessary, and provide personalized advice based on your medical history and examination findings.\n\nRemember to always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of your health concerns.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I keep pushing it with my tongue and clenching a bit against it and I just noticed that it has become loose little more. I have my wisdom teeth and I think it might be applying pressure forward on these teeth. I read in a book that day grinding can cause a teeth to loosen, which is easier to treat. There is no pain and the teeth look healthy. I always clench my teeth but it never caused any looseness.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What about your diet?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information that may be helpful. It's important to keep in mind that an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan can only be determined by a dentist or dental professional who can examine your teeth and evaluate the situation directly.\n\nLoose teeth can have several possible causes, including gum disease, trauma, tooth grinding (bruxism), or excessive pressure from surrounding teeth like in the case of erupted wisdom teeth pushing against other molars. In some cases, clenching or grinding your teeth can lead to tooth mobility over time.\n\nIf you suspect that your wisdom teeth are putting pressure on your first molar, it would be best to schedule a visit with a dentist for an evaluation. They will be able to assess the alignment and position of your wisdom teeth and determine if they are causing any issues for your adjacent teeth.\n\nA dentist may suggest treatments such as wearing a nightguard to protect your teeth from grinding during sleep or addressing any underlying gum disease. If necessary, they may recommend removing the wisdom teeth or providing orthodontic treatment to relieve the pressure on the first molar.\n\nRemember, it's always advisable to consult with a dental professional for a proper evaluation and personalized advice based on your specific condition.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

They started a root canal but then did not finish. I have gone back several times and every time they open up the tooth and insert medicine. My tooth is in agony right now. I am just wondering if this is a standard procedure during a root canal? Should not the dentist remove the nerves so I am not in so much pain? Or is it the standard procedure to fight the infection first and then remove the nerves?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n The doctor is ready to help you.\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information that may be helpful. During a root canal procedure, the objective is to remove the infected or damaged pulp tissue from within the tooth and clean the root canals before filling them with a biocompatible material. Typically, this involves removing the nerves (also known as dental pulp) along with any infected tissues.\n\nThe process you described, where your dentist has been placing medicine in the tooth during multiple visits, suggests that there might be a persistent infection. It's possible that your dentist is trying to eliminate the infection before completing the root canal treatment. In certain situations, dentists may prefer to manage the infection first using medication before proceeding with the final stages of the root canal.\n\nHowever, if you are experiencing intense pain and are unsure about the progress of your treatment, it would be best to reach out to your dentist for clarification.

Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me the same medication. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n It looks like your doctor is not very clear about the diagnosis. We need more information about the eye pain to help you.\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to help provide some general information. It seems like you are experiencing recurring pain in the corner of your left eye and are concerned about your eyesight. It's important to note that only a doctor who specializes in ophthalmology can properly diagnose and treat your condition. However, based on your description, it's possible that you may be dealing with chronic eye inflammation or dryness.\n\nThe medications you mentioned, Sterdex for pain relief and Chibro Cadron for eye allergy treatment, are commonly used for managing certain eye conditions. However, it's important to discuss any concerns or worsening symptoms with your doctor. They may need to reevaluate your condition, consider alternative treatment options, or perform further tests to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that wearing glasses and lenses may sometimes contribute to eye discomfort and dryness. Proper hygiene and cleaning techniques for your lenses, as well as regular breaks from wearing them, may be beneficial. Additionally, maintaining good overall eye health includes practices such as avoiding prolonged screen time, staying hydrated, and protecting your eyes from irritants or allergens.\n\nAgain, it's crucial to consult with an eye specialist who can evaluate your specific situation and provide you with appropriate guidance and treatment.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

It showed a hianal hernia 2 cm. I am attaching photos. The doctor took biopsies, said no cancer. I have had breast cancer in the past. I am having pain in the chest when I swallow, and sternum today. Will that subside? Is it from the bleeding? And, can you recommend the best pill to take for this pain, taking Pantoprazole now? And what should I take for this problem, what should I eat? (Can you assure there is no cancer)?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n How serious is this?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information that may help. It's great to hear that the biopsies during your EGD did not show any signs of cancer. The pain you're experiencing when swallowing and in your sternum might be related to the procedure itself or the healing process following the polypectomy. It could also be associated with acid reflux due to the hiatal hernia.\n\nThe best course of action would be to consult your doctor regarding the specific symptoms and concerns you are experiencing. They will be able to provide you with personalized advice on managing the pain and determining the appropriate medication for your situation. They may suggest changes to your diet, such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods, and possibly recommend lifestyle modifications, such as elevating the head of your bed while sleeping, to help alleviate symptoms.\n\nIt's important to address any persistent symptoms or concerns with your healthcare provider to ensure proper evaluation and management.

I am 173 cm in height and weighs about 68 kg. I would like to know about testosterone injection if I took it in a small dosage weekly will that help my appearance to be more manly? Even that my appearance is manly but in general my physical built is small compared to other men, my face, hands, legs are small also my voice is feminine.My testosterone level is good. My body is too hairy and I did a testosterone test everything was normal. I know there is a lot of studies that say that testosterone can lead to depression but actually at the age of 21 I was suffering from depression and I took testosterone for a month (to gain muscles), my mood was very good and it actually helped my depression. Also, my sexual life and erection are very good, I do masturbate once or twice every two days and I get an erection easily.Kindly help me with these questions:Will testosterone injections help me be more manly? What is the recommended dose that I have to take monthly? What are testosterone injections made from, are they made from an animal source? Will testosterone affects my personality? Do I have to take it for life? What if after some period I decided to stop will I loose what I gained?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Thank you for your answer. I will forward it to the doctor.\n\n## Output (b):\nAs an AI language model, I can provide you with some general information regarding testosterone injections, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\nTestosterone is the primary male sex hormone responsible for the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. Testosterone therapy may be considered by individuals with clinically confirmed low levels of testosterone (hypogonadism) or delayed puberty. It is generally not recommended for cosmetic purposes or to enhance physical appearance in individuals with normal testosterone levels.\n\nTestosterone injections can help increase muscle mass, strength, and potentially improve certain aspects related to masculinity. However, it's essential to understand that individual responses to testosterone therapy can vary, and the effects may be modest compared to genetic factors.\n\nThe dosage of testosterone injections depends on your specific situation and should be determined by a healthcare professional after assessing your hormone levels and considering other factors. The dosing frequency will also depend on the prescribed treatment plan and could range from weekly to less frequent intervals.\n\nTestosterone used in medical treatments is typically synthesized rather than sourced from animals. Pharmaceutical companies manufacture synthetic hormones that are similar to those produced naturally by the human body.\n\nRegarding personality changes, while testosterone can influence mood and behavior, the impact varies among individuals. Some may experience improved mood and energy levels, whereas others may notice little change. Remarkable personality changes due solely to testosterone therapy are generally uncommon.\n\nIf you start testosterone therapy as recommended by your healthcare provider, it doesn't necessarily mean you have to take it for life. Your doctor will\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Which is better at combating bad breath due to smoking than alcoholic? I am in a hygiene school and want to know whether or not to recommend non-alcohol mouthwash for the complaints of bad breath from smoking. I have recommended tongue scraping, alcoholic mouthwash. Anyways, they are not going to stop smoking or drinking. I was looking at a way to have them not dry out the tissues, but stopping the obvious factors do not seem to be an option.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Have you considered throat sprays?\n\n## Output (b):\nI am not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic mouthwashes both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Alcohol-based mouthwashes are generally effective in killing bacteria, reducing plaque build-up, and freshening breath. However, they can cause dryness of the oral tissues and may contribute to the development of oral conditions such as oral mucosal lesions or dry mouth.\n\nNon-alcoholic mouthwashes, on the other hand, do not contain alcohol and are less likely to cause dryness or irritation. They are still effective in freshening breath and reducing bacterial activity, although they may not be as potent as alcohol-based mouthwashes.\n\nIn the case of bad breath due to smoking, both types of mouthwash could potentially help alleviate the problem, but it is important to address the underlying cause rather than relying solely on mouthwash. Tobacco smoke can leave a strong odor behind, so managing oral hygiene alone may not fully eliminate the bad breath associated with smoking. Encouraging proper oral care practices, such as regular teeth brushing, flossing, tongue scraping, and using mouthwash, alongside quitting smoking is essential for managing bad breath effectively.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that recommending tobacco cessation methods to patients who smoke can significantly improve overall oral health and reduce the risk of developing oral diseases. If possible, you may want to discuss with your patients the importance of quitting smoking and suggest resources or programs that can assist them in their efforts to quit.\n\nRemember, I\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

My eyes still yellow. Is it unlikely hematologist who diagnosed me three years ago misdiagnosed? I do not doubt he knows his stuff. More about me getting worried. I lost weight a couple of months ago. I went very yellow in the eyes. I have always felt tired. I have had gallbladder out four years ago, I bruise easily, I do get little red skin dots at times, menstrual cycles can be irregular and spleen slightly enlarged.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What about your eyes?\n\n## Output (b):\nI am not a doctor, but I can provide some general information for you. Mild hereditary spherocytosis is a condition where red blood cells are spherical-shaped instead of their normal biconcave shape. This can lead to the destruction of these cells more easily, causing anemia and other symptoms.\n\nYellowing of the eyes (jaundice) can occur in hereditary spherocytosis due to the breakdown of red blood cells, which releases bilirubin into the bloodstream. Bilirubin is responsible for the yellowish color. It is possible that the hematologist correctly diagnosed you with mild hereditary spherocytosis three years ago.\n\nWeight loss, fatigue, and easy bruising are non-specific symptoms and could be related to various causes. However, it's essential to have these symptoms evaluated by a healthcare professional, potentially including your hematologist or primary care doctor. They can assess whether these symptoms could be related to your hereditary spherocytosis or if further investigations are needed.\n\nThe irregular menstrual cycles may or may not be directly related to hereditary spherocytosis. Hormonal imbalances or other factors can also contribute to menstrual irregularities. Again, discussing this with your doctor would be helpful in determining any potential connections.\n\nAs for the slightly enlarged spleen and skin dots, these findings could be associated with hereditary spherocytosis. Enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) can occur\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I checked my heart rate roughly three minutes after the incident and it was at 60 bpm and my oxygen was at 99 % under two weeks ago. I had a routine 24 tape which was clear (ectopic beats picked up but were benign). I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. However, they generally come on during stressful situations.

Normally, the normal range for platelet count is between 150,000 and 450,000 per microliter (mcL) of blood. A platelet count of 1314 does not fall within this range, so it is definitely abnormal.\n\nHaving an abnormally high platelet count, known as thrombocytosis, could be caused by various factors such as infection, inflammation, certain medications, spleen removal, or certain bone marrow disorders. It's also important to consider whether this result is consistent with your previous platelet levels as a significant change may indicate an underlying problem.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consult with a medical professional, preferably a hematologist, who can evaluate your full medical history, perform a physical examination, and order additional appropriate tests to determine the cause of your unusually high platelet count.

Another possibility could be lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise that may need attention. It's important to consult with your doctor to discuss these concerns and to work on finding the best treatment plan for you.\n\nSince your creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, T3, and TSH are normal, it indicates that your kidney function and liver enzymes are within the normal range, and your thyroid hormones are also in normal limits.\n\nPlease reach out to your healthcare provider for an evaluation and to discuss any changes or adjustments that may be necessary to better manage your diabetes.

Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a common over-the-counter medication for fever and pain relief. It is generally safe to take these two medications together, but it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional or pharmacist before combining different medicines.\n\nIf you have a fever, it would be ideal to focus on reducing the fever itself by taking paracetamol as directed and following other measures to manage symptoms like resting, staying hydrated, and using cool compresses.

I have no fever or other symptoms. Should I be concerned? I had my atlas which was supposedly two degrees off by an atlas orthogonal chiropractor. I originally went in because of my knee and wrist pain then before I knew it, I was having my atlas adjusted by a machine. My last few days I have been miserable and feeling awful. Exhausted, my lymph nodes are so painful on the sides of my neck I have been in bed all day. I just feel this might be related but I do not know.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did the chiropractor give you any medication for the lymph nodes?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some information that may be helpful. It is possible that the pain and swelling in your cervical lymph nodes could be related to the adjustment of your atlas. The lymph nodes in the neck can become swollen and tender as a result of inflammation or infection in the area they drain. However, it's important to note that there could be other potential causes for your symptoms as well.\n\nIt would be best to consult with a healthcare professional, such as your primary care physician or the chiropractor who performed the adjustment, to determine the cause of your symptoms. They will be able to evaluate your condition, take a detailed medical history, and perform any necessary examinations or tests to provide you with an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\n\nPlease remember that it is always important to seek professional medical advice rather than relying solely on online platforms for guidance.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I have had a lot of digestive problems for about two years. I have been diagnosed with candida and dysbiosis but my regular doctor does not seem to know what is wrong with me. I have been very stressed and have suffered anxiety since I was about 16. I was not on any medications and started taking Cymbalta a few months ago.After about three to four days, I started to notice a bit of burning in my feet. I have since stopped taking the Cymbalta about a month ago. My feet seemed fine. Then seven days ago, I have started getting really bad pain in my feet and burning and tickling and pins and needle feelings. I am not diabetic or alcoholic. I have no idea what has brought this on or whether it can be reversed. I am so stressed out. I have to be on my feet for my job for about four and a half hours every morning. Can this be tested to see if the nerve cells are either dead or just damaged and can it be reversed? This feels like it is going to ruin my life. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Doctor, when do you want to see the patient for follow up?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you with your symptoms. The burning and tingling sensations in your feet could be indicative of a condition called peripheral neuropathy. This is a type of nerve damage that commonly affects the feet and hands. The use of Cymbalta (duloxetine) has been associated with peripheral neuropathy as a potential side effect. However, it's important to note that other causes, such as diabetes or nutritional deficiencies, should also be ruled out.\n\nTo determine the extent of the nerve damage, there are various tests that can be performed, such as nerve conduction studies or electromyography. Seeing a neurologist would be beneficial in order to undergo these tests and receive a proper diagnosis.\n\nReversal of nerve damage depends on the underlying cause. If the peripheral neuropathy is due to medication side effects, discontinuing the medication may lead to some improvement over time. Additionally, managing stress levels and practicing relaxation techniques might be helpful.\n\nIt's essential that you reach out to your primary care physician or a specialist for further evaluation and guidance based on your specific situation. They will be able to provide accurate diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment options to alleviate your symptoms and improve your quality of life.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

After that, I got some tests done, which resulted in CMV IgG positive. Then I got vaccinated for rubella to prevent any casualties in the next pregnancy. Now I want to try and conceive, but just now I got my torch panel done again. And now the HSV IGM is positive with 1.15 range along with CMV and rubella IgG positive. Should I wait or can I try to conceive right now? My husband\\s torch panel also done, nothing abnormal.I am currently under Folic acid and Multivitamin, for now, to conceive faster. And also a homeopathic medicine for migraine.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else you want the doctor to know before I schedule your appointment?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm sorry to hear about your previous pregnancy loss. Based on the information you provided, it appears that you are currently positive for CMV IgG, rubella IgG, and HSV IgM. It is important to understand that I am an AI language model and not a doctor, so please consult with your healthcare provider for proper medical advice.\n\nCMV (Cytomegalovirus), rubella, and HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) can all potentially pose risks during pregnancy. CMV and rubella are generally of concern due to the possibility of fetal infection, while HSV may cause complications during delivery if active lesions are present at that time.\n\nIt's recommended that you discuss these results with your obstetrician or a reproductive health specialist. They will be able to assess the potential risks and provide guidance on when it's safe to try conceiving again. They may also recommend further testing or treatment options based on your specific situation.\n\nAdditionally, ensure you are taking your folic acid and multivitamin supplements as directed, as they are beneficial for overall reproductive health. Regarding the homeopathic medicine for migraine, it's important to inform your healthcare provider of any medications or treatments you are taking to ensure they don't interfere with your fertility or pregnancy plans.\n\nOverall, consult with a healthcare professional who can assess your specific situation and provide personalized advice to help guide your decision regarding trying to conceive.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

These small red pimples create a red area when seen from far away because they are very small and inflamed. It never disappears. My skin always feels stuck and not flexible and with a mildly itchy or burning sensation. No matter how much moisturizer I apply, it does not help. I am using Eucerin atopic control moisturizer and a gel cleanser with Hyaluronan. I even tried using Metronidazole and tea oil, but again it did not help. I have also tried to stop using anything on my face for some days, but it stayed the same. I am 24 years old now, and I never had acne tendencies when I was a teenager, and my skin always looked very smooth. My birth control pill is still the same as it was when I first started taking it, which wad around ten years ago. I do not use steroid creams nor fluoride toothpaste. How can I get rid of this? It was not there before a year. I am attaching a picture of my face. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Output (b):\nBased on your description, it is possible that you are experiencing a condition called perioral dermatitis. Perioral dermatitis is a common skin condition characterized by small, red, inflamed papules or pimples around the mouth, chin, and sometimes the nose. It can be itchy, burning, and resistant to traditional acne treatments.\n\nSeveral factors can contribute to the development of perioral dermatitis, including the use of topical steroids (such as those found in certain creams), fluorinated toothpaste, and hormonal changes like those caused by birth control pills.\n\nTreatment for perioral dermatitis typically involves avoiding triggers or irritants, such as harsh cleansers, cosmetic products, and excessive moisturization. It may also involve discontinuing the use of any steroid creams. Additionally, antibiotics, such as oral tetracyclines or erythromycin, are often prescribed to help reduce inflammation and control bacterial overgrowth. Your doctor may recommend a different course of treatment based on a physical examination.\n\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare professional or dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.

I originally felt the pain after playing lots of baseballs (swinging a baseball bat many times). I have symptoms such as tightness, limited mobility or restricted range of motion, throbbing pain, and sometimes it gets so bad that it became hard for me to even walk or sit! I went to my athletic trainer a month ago, and she told me she thinks it is just an aggravated muscle spasm. So she told me to just give it some rest from the activity that hurt it. So I gave it about a month, in which it seemed there was no pain. But as soon as I tried to do the activity that hurt me in the first place, it went right back to hurting. It would be of great help for any assistance. What should I do now?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Please help! What should I do now?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but it sounds like you may be experiencing recurrent lower back muscle spasms. It's possible that the initial injury was not fully healed or that there is an underlying issue contributing to the spasms. To address this, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Rest and Ice: Take some time off from the activity that triggers the pain and apply ice packs to the affected area for 15-20 minutes several times a day. This can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.\n\n2. Gentle Stretching and Strengthening Exercises: Once the acute pain subsides, you can start with gentle stretching exercises for your lower back muscles. Gradually incorporate strengthening exercises to improve the stability of your back muscles.\n\n3. Physical Therapy: Consider seeking out a physical therapist who can evaluate your posture, movement patterns, and provide targeted exercises and techniques to alleviate the muscle spasms.\n\n4. Pain Medications: Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen might help manage pain and reduce inflammation. However, consult with a healthcare professional before starting any medication.\n\n5. Heat Therapy: Applying heat to the affected area using a heating pad or warm compresses may help relax the tight muscles and promote blood flow.\n\n6. Proper Body Mechanics: Make sure you are using proper body mechanics during activities that involve repetitive motion or heavy lifting. Improper form can strain the back muscles and lead to spasms.\n\nIf the symptoms persist or worsen despite conservative\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Negative home pregnancy tests and a negative test at the doctor's office can occur if the hormone levels indicating pregnancy are too low to be detected. \n\nRegarding the possibility of another fetus remaining inside, it is less likely but not impossible. However, it's important for your partner to consult with her healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and guidance.\n\nRegarding the bleeding for seven days that she attributed to the Plan B pill, it's possible that this was just a normal menstrual period or a withdrawal bleed from the hormonal changes caused by the Plan B pill.\n\nIn any case, it would be best for your partner to follow up with her healthcare provider to discuss her symptoms, concerns, and any further testing that may be necessary. They will have a better understanding of her specific situation and can provide appropriate medical advice.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I have had a couple of speech therapy sessions but progress is glacial. I am still hoarse and in pain. I have been on 40 mg of Omeprazole for a month and Gaviscon Double Action for two weeks. I feel like the back of my throat is still swollen and I have pain in the corners of my throat. This only briefly eases when I really do some throat opening exercises. I cannot talk for very long without everything getting sore still. I have been like this since the beginning of the year since I had a chest infection and pneumonia. My mouth is now getting sore from all the Gaviscon tablets as the liquid irritates the corners of my throat. I really do not know what else I can do. I am having panic attacks and starting to feel like the only option is to take my life. I had a post nasal drip for most of the year so far and I am trying to get my salivary glands to work again properly.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Do you have any more questions for the doctor?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I can't provide the help that you need.

It just got worse. I play soccer and that and the sweat is what was irritating it. So I finally went to the doctor and they prescribed me SMZ, TMP DS. I took it for about a week until I realized I was having a lot of side effects and an allergic reaction especially around my mouth. At first I thought I was just breaking out. Then it was not like sores or blisters. I kept self-treating the rash around my mouth and stopped taking the antibiotics. For a couple days it was gone. I was happy. Then I was in the sun one day for soccer and it was just like another rash but worse. I stayed home from school, did not do anything because I just wanted to get it better. But now it looks really bad. I believe I have perioral dermatitis. It is red patches all around my mouth. It is really dry and scaly, also there are like white-heads around my mouth also but they are not whiteheads. I would try to moisturize it with coconut oil or tea tree oil but I think that is what made it worse.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Does the patient have any of the following symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm sorry to hear about your condition. Based on your description, it is possible that you are experiencing perioral dermatitis, which is a common skin condition that causes red, scaly patches around the mouth. Perioral dermatitis can be triggered by various factors, including the use of topical steroids, certain cosmetic products, and even some medications.\n\nIt's important to note that I am an AI language model, and I cannot diagnose or provide specific medical advice without examining you in person. However, here are a few general recommendations:\n\n1. Stop using any irritants or potential triggers such as coconut oil or tea tree oil on the affected area.\n2. Avoid using any harsh cleansers or cosmetics around the mouth that may further irritate the skin.\n3. Gently cleanse the affected area with a mild, non-fragrant cleanser and rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water.\n4. Be cautious with sun exposure, as sunlight can worsen the symptoms. Consider applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen to protect the affected area if necessary.\n5. It's advisable to consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. They may recommend topical creams or oral antibiotics, depending on the severity and underlying cause of your condition.\n\nRemember, it's essential to seek medical advice from a healthcare professional who can evaluate your specific situation and recommend the most appropriate course of action.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I would like to obtain technical info regarding these results, particularly regarding the infarction. I would appreciate the severity of this infarction and whether it could be a machine error. Could you also tell me by perhaps drawing on the shot what waves and shapes indicate problems?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n The report indicates that there is an infarction on the left ventricle and that a stress test was performed.\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not able to view or analyze any attachments or images. However, I can offer you some general information about treadmill stress tests and the interpretation of results.\n\nA treadmill stress test is a common diagnostic test used to evaluate the function of the heart during increased physical exertion. It helps detect any abnormalities in blood flow to the heart muscle and identify possible signs of coronary artery disease.\n\nDuring the test, the patient walks on a treadmill while their heart rate, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) readings are monitored. The ECG provides information about the electrical activity of the heart, which can indicate if there are any issues such as poor blood flow or previous infarctions (heart attacks).\n\nTo assess the severity of an infarction or determine if it could be a machine error, a physician typically reviews the ECG tracings along with the patient's symptoms, medical history, and other diagnostic tests. It may also be necessary to compare the current stress test results with previous ones to look for any changes over time.\n\nWhile certain waveforms and shapes on an ECG can signify potential problems, it highly depends on the clinical context and specific findings. It would be best to discuss your test results and concerns directly with your doctor. They will have access to the complete information and are qualified to interpret the results accurately.\n\nRemember, only a healthcare professional who has examined you and reviewed your medical records can provide you with a precise\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

A single white lump around the tonsil area could be due to a variety of causes and doesn't automatically indicate cancer. Some possible explanations include:\n\n1. Tonsillitis: Inflammation or infection of the tonsils can lead to swelling and the formation of white spots or patches.\n2. Tonsil stones (tonsilloliths): These are small, hard deposits that can form in the crevices of the tonsils. They may appear as white or yellowish lumps.\n3. Oral thrush (Candida infection): This is a fungal infection that can cause white plaques or patches on the tonsils or elsewhere in the mouth.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that only a medical professional can accurately diagnose your condition. If you're concerned or experiencing persistent symptoms, it's recommended that you consult with a healthcare provider who can examine your throat and provide an appropriate diagnosis.

All her life she thought she had a problem with her heart but she went to see a doctor and he said she is in perfect health. She starts shaking and cannot breathe and I am really scared and try to calm her down but she cannot breathe. She cannot stop shaking for at least half an hour. I do not know what to do and I hope you can tell me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What is the patient's age?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but it sounds like your friend may be experiencing severe panic attacks related to her anxiety disorder. Panic attacks can be very distressing and may manifest with symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, shaking, and a feeling of impending doom. It's important for your friend to seek professional help from a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, who can evaluate her symptoms and provide appropriate treatment options.\n\nIn the meantime, when someone is having a panic attack, it may be helpful to:\n\n1. Encourage slow, deep breaths: Encourage your friend to take slow and deep breaths in through their nose and out through their mouth. This can help regulate their breathing and reduce feelings of breathlessness.\n\n2. Practice grounding techniques: Guiding your friend to focus on the present moment can help distract from the panic. Encourage her to notice and describe her surroundings, find objects to touch, or count backwards from 100.\n\n3. Offer reassurance and support: Let your friend know that you are there for her and that what she is experiencing will pass. Try to remain calm yourself, as this can have a positive effect on her state of mind.\n\n4. Avoid judgment and don't force her to calm down: Be understanding and patient, as panicking individuals may feel overwhelmed by others' reactions. Don't pressure her to \"snap out\" of the panic attack; rather allow her to work through it at her own pace.\n\nRemember, I am\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Recently, I have elevated AST levels. There is no hepatitis or inflammatory diseases, alcohol, drug use, or fatty liver, or Addison\\s.Liver biopsy showed inflammation, but a resolving process likely attributed to a year long Lyme disease treatment with various pharmaceuticals but discontinued two years ago. Liver enzymes dropped to 50 ALT, but have recently elevated to 130 ALT.At this point, there is no known cause. I was told to continue to wait and see. I would like to take a different approach and determine if there is something my hepatologist is not seeing. The current medications are Lamictal and Gabapentin, Trazodone. I had abdominal CT, abdominal MRI, liver biopsy, ultrasounds, and a significant amount of blood work.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Are you the patient?\n\n## Output (b):\nI am an AI language model, not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information based on your description. Elevated levels of liver enzymes ALT and AST can indicate liver inflammation or damage. Since you mentioned that there is no hepatitis, fatty liver, or inflammatory diseases, it would be important to consider other possible causes.\n\nSome potential causes for elevated liver enzymes include medication side effects, autoimmune liver diseases, genetic disorders, metabolic conditions, or certain infections (other than hepatitis). If you have ruled out these possibilities, further investigation may be needed to identify the underlying cause.\n\nConsidering your medical history with Lyme disease treatment and use of different pharmaceuticals in the past, it could be worth discussing this with your hepatologist. They may want to review the medications you are currently taking as well as any that you have taken in the past, to determine if they could contribute to the elevated liver enzyme levels. It may also be helpful to consult with a specialist in hepatology or gastroenterology for a second opinion.\n\nSince you have already undergone several tests including CT scans, MRI, ultrasound, and liver biopsy, it's good that you have been thoroughly evaluated. However, it would still be beneficial to discuss your concerns about the persistently elevated liver enzymes with your healthcare provider. Continuing regular follow-ups and monitoring the liver enzyme levels will be important to track any changes or new developments.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

All were negative. The antibody test I took is not a fourth generation test. Is it conclusive or should I take another test? If I repeat the HIV test after six months what is the chance of staying negative? I am facing the problem like small bumps in the tongue, from the last two days a little bit of pain below ear region and it is a little swollen. Is it due to HIV? I am stressed, scared, full of tension. These are hampering my life. I do not know what to do. Today I am in the 107th day of exposure.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Thank you for your question.\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information. \n\nBased on the information you provided, it is encouraging that all three tests conducted so far have returned negative results. However, it is important to note that different types of HIV tests have varying window periods, which is the time between potential exposure and when a test can accurately detect antibodies or the virus itself.\n\nFor most standard ELISA antibody tests, the window period is approximately 4-6 weeks. The proviral DNA PCR test has an even shorter window period of around 10-14 days. So, taking these factors into account, your negative results from the tests performed at 49 days, 71 days (PCR), and 87 days should provide reasonably reliable indications of your HIV status.\n\nWhile repeat testing after six months can further reinforce the accuracy of your current negative results, it is highly unlikely for someone with persistently negative results beyond 3 months to subsequently test positive.\n\nRegarding your symptoms, it's important to remember that they are quite common and non-specific. Small bumps on the tongue and pain/swelling in the ear region are not specific to HIV infection and can occur due to numerous other reasons such as minor infections, inflammation, or irritation. It would be best to consult with a healthcare professional who can perform a thorough evaluation and provide appropriate advice.\n\nIt seems evident that your anxieties surrounding this situation are affecting your daily life.

I have never really taken them off. I would sleep with the contact lenses in my eyes and I have started wearing them since I was 13 years old. I would change them, but I would not take them off, and I would go days. My vision gets worse when I go to the eye doctor, but I have not had problems with infections. Recently I noticed that my left eye is red without pain or irritation, but red as the color of the pink eye. I do not know if it is the contact lenses which is causing the redness. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm sorry to hear about your concerns. Based on the information you provided, it is possible that the redness in your left eye could be related to your contact lens use. Sleeping with your contacts in and not giving your eyes a break from wearing them can increase the risk of certain complications.\n\nOne possibility is that you are experiencing a condition called corneal neovascularization, which occurs when blood vessels start growing into the cornea due to long-term contact lens wear. This can cause redness and other symptoms. Additionally, prolonged contact lens use without proper hygiene and cleaning can increase the risk of infection, even if you haven't experienced one yet.\n\nI would highly recommend making an appointment with an eye doctor as soon as possible. They will be able to examine your eyes and determine the exact cause of the redness. In the meantime, it's important to stop wearing your contact lenses and give your eyes a break.

I was doing it too fast, and at one point, I got a sharp pain in my back, near where my ribs meet my spine. Since then, I am also having very sharp pain when inhaling and exhaling, as well as when rotating my torso or neck. Should I need to go for urgent care? Currently, I am taking Zyrtec, Amino acid supplements for energy and muscle recovery, hormonal IUD.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What is the timing of your symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information. Based on your description, it's possible that you may have strained or injured a muscle in your back during the shoulder press exercise. The sharp pain during breathing and movement could indicate an irritation of the muscles involved in these movements.\n\nIn most cases, musculoskeletal injuries like this can be managed at home with rest, ice, heat, over-the-counter pain relievers, and avoiding activities that worsen the pain. However, if the pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms such as difficulty breathing or numbness, it would be best to seek medical attention. Only a healthcare professional can accurately diagnose and provide specific recommendations based on a physical examination and possibly further tests.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth mentioning any relevant medical history and medications to your healthcare provider when seeking advice.\n\nDisclaimer: This response is for informational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice.

The last week I have had constant headaches and periodic blurry vision. I am wondering if this could be a result of not wearing my glasses. How often should I be wearing my glasses? The periodic blurry vision started two weeks ago and one week ago the constant headache started (4 to 6 out of 10). I have seen a few different doctors about it but they are not sure.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is it true that you experience headaches, constant?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information. Astigmatism occurs when the cornea or lens of the eye is irregularly shaped, causing blurry vision at all distances. Wearing glasses with the appropriate prescription can help correct the astigmatism and improve vision. \n\nBased on your description, it's possible that your headaches and periodic blurry vision are related to not wearing your glasses. Without the corrective lenses, your eyes may have to work harder to focus, resulting in strain and discomfort. It would be best to consult an optometrist or ophthalmologist who can evaluate your symptoms and determine the appropriate course of action.\n\nThe frequency of wearing glasses depends on the severity of your astigmatism and the recommendation of your eye care professional. Some individuals with mild astigmatism may only need to wear glasses for certain activities, while others may require them throughout the day for optimal vision. It's important to follow the advice of your eye care professional and wear your glasses as prescribed.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

It's important to seek dental care as soon as possible for proper evaluation and treatment. Based on your description, it is recommended that you see a dentist or endodontist (a root canal specialist) who can assess the situation and determine the appropriate course of action.\n\nThe tooth movement and bleeding could indicate various possibilities:\n\n1. Tooth displacement: The injury may have caused the tooth to move within its socket, leading to bleeding from the gums surrounding the affected tooth.\n2. Tooth avulsion: In more severe cases, the tooth may have been completely knocked out of its socket, resulting in bleeding from the area where the tooth was located.\n3. Damage to supporting structures: It's also possible that the injury has caused damage to the tissues that support the tooth, such as the periodontal ligament or the surrounding bone.\n\nThe specific treatment will depend on the severity of the injury and the clinical examination findings by the dentist or endodontist. This may include repositioning and stabilizing the tooth, splinting it to neighboring teeth, prescribing antibiotics if necessary, and assessing if any follow-up root canal treatment or additional procedures are required.\n\nIn the meantime, try to avoid touching or putting pressure on the affected tooth to minimize further damage. Apply gentle pressure with a clean gauze or cloth to control any bleeding. If there is persistent bleeding or significant pain, consider visiting an emergency department for immediate care.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult with\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

This can lead to a burning sensation in the chest, discomfort around the belly button area, and sometimes a sour taste in the mouth.\n\nAnother possibility is that you may be experiencing an allergic reaction or food intolerance to the foods you mention. Allergic reactions can cause symptoms such as itching, abdominal pain, and even a metallic taste in the mouth.\n\nIt is also possible that these symptoms could be related to a gastrointestinal infection or inflammation, such as gastritis or gastroenteritis. These conditions can cause abdominal pain, discomfort, and occasionally a warm sensation in the abdomen.\n\nTo determine the exact cause of your symptoms, it is important to seek medical evaluation and have a thorough physical examination.

I am 5\\7\" in height and140 lbs weight. My dad is 5\\9, and my mom is 5\\1. I would like to at least reach 5\\9 to 5\\10. My diet is exceptional. I am taking a multivitamin, and I do not have any deficiencies. I am thinking of taking 1500 mg of Glucosamine because I read studies concluding that it may help a bit. Would you recommend glucosamine, or something else?Also, do you think I can still reach my height goal? I am worried that I may have stunted my growth. I have had insomnia, depression, and anxiety for four years now. This has affected my life considerably, and I am worried I would not grow to my potential height because of it. I also have not been getting too much calcium and protein because I have been avoiding dairy products. Should I be drinking more milk and if so, how much?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n## Output (b):\nI am not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information based on your description. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\nFirstly, your height is mainly determined by genetics, especially the heights of your parents. While adequate nutrition plays a role in growth, reaching your potential height depends on various factors, including genetic predisposition and overall health. As you mentioned that your diet is exceptional and you are taking a multivitamin, it seems like you are already prioritizing your nutritional needs.\n\nRegarding glucosamine, it is commonly used as a dietary supplement for joint health, but its impact on growth has not been extensively studied. It is not typically recommended for promoting height growth in individuals who have reached their late teens. If you are interested in exploring other options to support your growth, it would be best to discuss this with a healthcare professional who can consider your specific situation.\n\nInsomnia, depression, and anxiety can potentially affect overall well-being, which may indirectly influence growth. Addressing these conditions with appropriate medical help, such as therapy or medication if needed, could be beneficial.\n\nAs for calcium and protein intake, they are essential for proper bone growth and development. If you are avoiding dairy products, it's important to find alternative sources of calcium such as fortified non-dairy milk, leafy greens, tofu, almonds, and sardines. Additionally, incorporating protein-rich foods like lean meats, fish, eggs, legumes, and nuts into your diet\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Sciatica is a condition where the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back down the leg, becomes compressed or irritated. This can cause pain, numbness, and tingling that radiates down the leg.\n\nA herniated disc occurs when the soft inner material of a spinal disc pushes through a weak spot in the outer shell, putting pressure on nearby nerves. This can cause localized back pain near the spine, as well as pain that radiates down the leg.\n\nBoth conditions can be aggravated by certain movements, such as going downstairs or sitting on hard surfaces, and can also be associated with nerve pain or discomfort in specific positions, such as using the commode or sitting on the ground after eating.\n\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare professional, preferably a doctor or orthopedic specialist, who can evaluate your specific symptoms, conduct a physical examination, and possibly order additional tests (such as imaging studies) to provide an accurate diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment options. They may suggest conservative measures like physical therapy, pain management techniques, or medications initially, and if these don't provide relief, they may consider other interventions like injections or surgery.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

All other reports are normal.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n If you are a nurse or a medical assistant, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n## Output (b):\nBased on the information provided, your hemoglobin level of 14.3 is within the normal range. Similarly, your platelet count of 174,000 falls within the normal range as well.\n\nElevated levels of SGOT (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and SGPT (Alanine Aminotransferase) indicate liver damage or injury. The normal range for SGOT is typically between 5-40 units per liter, while the normal range for SGPT is usually between 7-56 units per liter. Your SGOT level of 38.9 falls within the normal range, but your SGPT level of 65.0 is slightly elevated.\n\nA vitamin D level of 23.6 ng/mL may be considered insufficient, as the desired optimal range is typically between 30-50 ng/mL. This indicates a potential deficiency that can be managed through supplementation or changes in diet and sun exposure.\n\nIt's important to note that these results should be interpreted in the context of your overall health history, symptoms, and any other relevant diagnostic tests. Therefore, I recommend discussing these findings with your healthcare provider to further assess your condition and determine any necessary treatment or follow-up.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I am 173 cm. My mother is 173 cm and father is 189 cm. I had a blood test to determine my HGH levels. The doctor asked me for a testosterone and GH test. The result came back a week later and it said that I had a low HGH level and a 21/42 level testosterone. Is this normal for an 18 year old male? I was devastated that my growth plates were closed, because I also had an x-ray of left hand. My doctor asked me whether I am sexually active. I answered him no. But, I got a doubt regarding erectile dysfunction. Am I suffering from erectile dysfunction? Should I be worried? Is my testosterone too low? How can I increase testosterone? I had torsion three years back and nothing back happened. But, this could be a factor. Another factor may be that I used to hold my mobile phone in my pocket all the time.I am a sprint athlete and have defined leg muscles, but this could be due to my short stature. I have gone for another blood test for GH, just as a follow up and that time I was advised to fast for 14 hours. But, I did not fast during my first blood test. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What is your age?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information based on your description. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.\n\nRegarding your height, genetics play a significant role in determining your final height. However, if you feel that you haven't reached your expected height potential, it may be worth discussing with your doctor if there are any underlying factors such as growth hormone deficiency (low HGH) or other medical conditions that could be affecting your growth.\n\nA testosterone level of 21/42 may be within the normal range for an 18-year-old male, but it would be best to have your results interpreted by a healthcare professional who can take into account your specific circumstances and symptoms.\n\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is a condition characterized by persistent difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection. Based on your description, it doesn't seem like you have mentioned any symptoms related to ED. If you have concerns regarding erectile function, it's advisable to discuss them with your doctor who can assess your specific situation and conduct further evaluations if necessary.\n\nTo increase testosterone levels, lifestyle modifications may help, such as maintaining a healthy weight, regular exercise, managing stress, getting enough sleep, and a balanced diet. However, it's important to note that these changes may not significantly impact testosterone levels in individuals who have clinically low testosterone. Your doctor will be able to guide you on appropriate management options if needed.\n\nThe history of torsion, where the testicle twists due\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I feel that I am recovering normally from what I was told and what I read. However, the area immediately above my belly button is extremely sore and appears to almost be bulging and is slightly elevated when touched. I did have my follow up and questioned this area and he cited the muscle repair and the liposuction but I wanted to get a second opinion on this and see if anyone has had similar experiences that are normal.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Does this area feel hard?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information. It's important to note that without personally examining you or having access to your medical records, it is difficult to provide an accurate assessment or diagnosis. However, I can provide some guidance based on common knowledge.\n\nAfter a tummy tuck with liposuction and muscle repair, it is normal to experience soreness and swelling in the surgical area. The bulging and slight elevation you mentioned may be due to inflammation and fluid buildup commonly seen during the healing process.\n\nDuring a tummy tuck, the abdominal muscles are tightened, and this can cause discomfort or pain as they heal. Liposuction involves removing excess fat from areas by suctioning it out, which also contributes to postoperative soreness.\n\nHowever, since you are concerned about this specific area, it would be best to follow up with your surgeon for a thorough evaluation. They will be able to assess your situation accurately and determine if any intervention or additional measures are needed.\n\nAs always, trust your instincts and seek professional medical advice if you have concerns regarding your recovery after surgery.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I usually ace my tests because I have a very short term memory, so cramming often makes do. But, I often tend to forget things when my body takes the so-called auto-pilot mode. During these times, I tend to do things with me, not really focusing on doing it because I was thinking of something else. I cannot really recall what exactly happened in a day when nothing special has occurred. I often forget where I put things, even when they are already in front of me, or in my hand. I seem to misplace habitually and it has pertrubed my parents. Now I am wandering if these are early symptoms of Alzheimer\\s. Please reply, and if you want to ask questions about me,feel free.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Excuse me, doctor, there are some questions that we need to ask about the patient's health history.\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information. It's important to remember that only a qualified healthcare professional can make an accurate diagnosis. While forgetfulness and difficulty focusing can be frustrating, it does not necessarily mean that you have early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. There can be many reasons for memory issues, including stress, lack of sleep, certain medications, or even nutritional deficiencies.\n\nIf your symptoms are significantly impacting your daily life and causing concern, it would be a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider.

I think she also has rheumatoid arthritis. For the past five years, she was managing the pain with anti-inflammatory medicine, Lyrica, Mythycobal, Voltaren injections, herbal creams, etc. You can see the veins in her hands popping out. I also realized that the pain has got worse now.For about 12 months the doctor put her only on Prednisolone 5 mg/day and painkiller when necessary. She was fine till last month but the pain increased in her hands now. In the daytime she is fine and the pain starts mildly in the evening. When she lies down in the bed she gets electrical tingling in her legs by which her sleep gets disturbed. She has undergone several tests last week and I attached them for your reference. She did not consult a rheumatologist yet. What medication can I give to reduce the inflammation and cure her? Her ESR, CPR, and ANA are quite high. The pain in her hands and the tingling in her legs at night are agonizing her life. Kindly provide your expert advice.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What medication does your mother currently take?\n\n## Output (b):\nI'm sorry to hear about your mother's condition. From the symptoms you described, it is possible that she is experiencing a flare-up of her rheumatoid arthritis along with worsening pain in her hands and tingling in her legs at night. It would be important for her to consult with a rheumatologist for a proper evaluation and management plan.\n\nBased on the information provided, I can suggest some general recommendations, but please keep in mind that these are not specific treatment options and should not replace the advice of a healthcare professional who has reviewed her complete medical history and performed a physical examination:\n\n1. Medications: Rheumatoid arthritis is typically managed with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate or sulfasalazine. These medications help to reduce inflammation, slow down joint damage, and improve symptoms over time. Additionally, a rheumatologist may consider adding or adjusting glucocorticoids (like prednisolone) to manage flare-ups when necessary.\n\n2. Pain management: In addition to anti-inflammatory medication, your mother may benefit from other pain management strategies such as physical therapy, heat/cold therapy, and gentle exercises to improve joint mobility and strength. Some patients find relief from complementary therapies like acupuncture or mindfulness techniques as well.\n\n3. Lifestyle modifications: Encourage your mother to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep. This can help improve overall well-being and potentially alleviate some of the symptoms\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}
