It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the infection is still present in your body, and it is recommended that you get examined by a doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms. Depending on the results of the examination, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or other medications to treat the infection. In the meantime, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help relieve your symptoms.

Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Have you experienced any of the following with your pregnancy?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nUnfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on a variety of factors such as the amount of cocaine used, the frequency of use, and the individual's metabolism. Generally, cocaine can stay in the body for up to 72 hours, but it can remain in the system for up to a week or more. It is also important to note that cocaine can remain in sperm for up to 5 days after use. Therefore, it is best to wait at least a week before trying to conceive to ensure that the cocaine is out of your system.

I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Are you male or female? Please select one.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is normal to have some residual brown discharge after your period. This is usually caused by old blood that has been in the uterus for a while and is now being expelled. It is not usually a cause for concern. However, if the discharge is accompanied by any other symptoms such as pain, itching, or a foul odor, then you should see your doctor for further evaluation. As for the bleeding during sex, this could be caused by a number of things such as an infection or a hormonal imbalance.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg.

I'll now ask you a series of questions to help you better.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the hard lump is due to swelling from the wisdom tooth extraction.

It is important to follow up with your dentist to make sure that the lump is not something more serious. If it is due to swelling, it should go away with time.

Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did you do any research?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to give you a definitive answer without more information.

I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n It might be best to start with a doctor who can physically examine the patient.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nBacterial vaginosis is a common condition that can cause a fishy odor. It is usually treated with antibiotics, such as Metronidazole. However, if the infection is not treated, it can lead to more serious complications, such as infertility. The risk of infertility is low, but it is important to seek medical attention if you are concerned about your symptoms. Your doctor can help you determine the best course of treatment for your condition. Additionally, there are some lifestyle changes that can help reduce the risk of recurrent bacterial vaginosis, such as avoiding douching, wearing loose-fitting clothing, and avoiding scented soaps and products.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else the doctor has asked you about?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to diagnose your condition without a physical examination. However, it is possible that you are experiencing a form of facial nerve dysfunction, such as trigeminal neuralgia or Bell's palsy. It is also possible that you are experiencing a form of anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. I would recommend that you see a neurologist for a physical examination and further testing to determine the cause of your symptoms. Additionally, it may be beneficial to speak with a mental health professional to assess for any underlying anxiety or stress that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

She had been treated for TB (tuberculosis) of the abdomen as her ultrasound of abdomen finding was thicken bowel loop. In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition. But, her neuro problem of numbness in her legs and loss of sensation in legs still continues. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did you also consult a cardiologist?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt sounds like your mother has been through a lot. It is difficult to give a definitive diagnosis without a full medical evaluation. However, it is possible that her symptoms are due to a combination of her TB treatment, her fall, and her arthritis. It is also possible that she has developed a peripheral neuropathy due to the TB treatment. I would recommend that she see a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment. The neurologist may recommend further testing such as an MRI or nerve conduction studies to help determine the cause of her symptoms. They may also recommend medications or physical therapy to help manage her symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I am taking Afrin spray for an hour and one pill of Sudafed. I developed a similar condition of cold and sinus infection before six months. I had severe clogging of ears. I was given Amoxicillin for five days and Prednisone 5 mg. My ENT doctor examined my ears and told me that there was no issue with the eardrum. He diagnosed it as eustachian tube issue. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What are your symptoms? What kinds of things were you experiencing?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt sounds like you may have a chronic eustachian tube dysfunction. This is a condition where the eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the back of the nose, does not open and close properly. This can cause a buildup of fluid in the middle ear, leading to clogged ears and other symptoms. The treatment for this condition is usually a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. Your doctor may recommend a decongestant such as Sudafed to help reduce the swelling in the eustachian tube. They may also recommend a steroid such as prednisone to reduce inflammation. In addition, your doctor may suggest avoiding allergens and irritants that can worsen your symptoms. If these treatments do not help, your doctor may recommend a procedure to open the eustachian tube. This procedure is called a myringotomy.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

My mother is 50 years old. She complains of episodic, sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon. This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother. She has a history of menorrhagia and cycles have become more irregular now. Then, diagnostic D and C was performed last year, which was normal. She will not smoke or drink. She sleeps 4 to 6 hours daily and snores at night.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Does your mother have any other symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nBased on the information provided, it is likely that your mother is suffering from a combination of conditions. It is possible that she is experiencing pain in her knees due to osteoarthritis, hip pain due to swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping due to a musculoskeletal disorder, and shoulder stiffness due to a rotator cuff injury. Additionally, her episodic sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon could be due to a tendon injury or tear. It is important to have her evaluated by a physician to determine the exact cause of her symptoms and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}
