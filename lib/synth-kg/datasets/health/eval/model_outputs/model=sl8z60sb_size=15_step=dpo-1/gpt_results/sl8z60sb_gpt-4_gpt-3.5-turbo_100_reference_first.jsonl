It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear you're experiencing these symptoms. Your description suggests that you might have had orchitis, which is inflammation of one or both testes and common in people who get mumps after puberty. Orchitis can indeed result in a decrease in testicle size and potential fertility issues.\n\nWhile it's difficult to definitely say without an examination, the persistence of your symptoms does indicate there may be ongoing issues or complications like chronic epididymitis (inflammation of the tube at the back of the testicle).\n\nIt is essential for you to see a urologist as soon as possible for further evaluation and management. They can perform ultrasound imaging studies or other tests to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment. Avoiding sexual activity till you visit and receive advice from the doctor would also be prudent.\n\nAs for antibiotics, it's best not to self-medicate as this requires a prescription based on a thorough assessment of infection type, severity and your overall health status. An inappropriate antibiotic usage could lead to resistance and make any lingering infection more difficult to treat.\n\nPlease schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider or urologist immediately to address these concerns.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nCocaine generally leaves the body within a few days. It is normally not detectable in blood or saliva tests after 1 to 2 days, and in urine tests it can be detected up to 3 days, but this can extend to about two weeks with heavy use. The half-life of cocaine is relatively short, about 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\n\nIn terms of impact on sperm, cocaine has been found to cause abnormalities in sperm shape, number, and movement, which could potentially affect fertility. There isn't a specific time frame linked to how long cocaine stays in sperm, as such effects depend on individual metabolism and frequency of use.\n\nWhile there aren't definitive guidelines for this situation, it's generally recommended for couples trying to conceive to avoid illicit drugs altogether, because of potential harm to both prospective parents and the potential child. It is advisable to seek further advice from your own healthcare provider who knows your personal circumstances.\n\nIt's also important to consider lifestyle choices that promote healthy fertility. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity, and abstaining from alcohol, tobacco and other harmful substances can all help improve fertility outcomes.\n\nYou should share this information with your healthcare provider so they can provide you with accurate guidance based on their knowledge of your overall health condition.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Have you experienced any of the following symptoms associated with cocaine use?

I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like you're experiencing breakthrough bleeding, which can occur when the hormonal levels in your body fluctuate. When on oral contraceptives like Yaz, skipping sugar pills and prolonging the time before having a period can potentially lead to irregularities including breakthrough bleeding or spotting.\n\nThe brown discharge is likely old blood that didn't fully exit during your period. If it doesn't clear up within a few days to a week, or if you notice other symptoms like an unusual vaginal odor, itchiness, burning sensation, or pelvic pain, contact your healthcare provider as there could be another issue, such as infection or inflammation.\n\nAs for the bleeding during sex, this could also be related to breakthrough bleeding or might indicate cervical irritation. It should subside with your next menstrual cycle. Still, recurrent or heavy bleeding during sex warrants medical attention to rule out more serious conditions like polyps, infection, or rarely, cervical cancer.\n\nIf these conditions persist or cause concern, it would be best to consult with your healthcare provider who might want to adjust your contraceptive regimen or investigate other causes behind these symptoms. \n\nKeep in mind, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation.

I am now very worried what good precautions should I take with him. Can you suggest me what should I do?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour son has a high degree of myopia (nearsightedness), which means he can see things clearly that are close, but things in the distance will look blurred. This condition is fairly common and manageable with corrective measures like glasses or contact lenses. Some precautions and steps you can take include:\n\n1. Regular Eye Check-ups: Ensure he gets regular eye checkups so that any worsening of his myopia can be detected early.\n\n2. Corrective Lenses: Be consistent with use of prescribed eyeglasses or contact lenses. Take care to replace them as advised by the optometrist if your son's prescription changes.\n\n3. Monitor Screen Time: Limit the time spent on digital devices given that excessive screen time can strain eyes and contribute to progressive myopia. Encourage him to take frequent breaks using the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\n\n4. Encourage Outdoor Activities: Increase outdoor activities, as studies have indicated they could slow down the progression of myopia.\n\n5. Good Lighting: Make sure he always reads and writes under good light conditions to limit the strain on his eyes. \n\n6. Healthy Diet: Nurture a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which are beneficial for eye health.\n\n7. Posture: Teach him the correct posture while reading or writing to avoid unnecessary strain on the eyes and body.\n\nThese precautions can help manage your son's condition.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe lump you are describing could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. Postoperative Swelling: After an extraction or a surgical procedure, swelling of the surrounding tissues is common and can sometimes feel like a hard lump. This should subside as the healing progresses.\n \n2. Abscess/Infection: Although not as common since you're already taking Amoxicillin, which is an antibiotic, it's possible that there could have been an infection forming around the extraction site causing this lumpy feel.\n\n3. Bone Spurring: Sometimes after extractions, small sharp pieces of bone can push their way out from the extraction site. These are usually normal, but can feel like a hard lump until they either come fully out or resorb into the body.\n\nGiven that the lower wisdom tooth was removed only six days ago, swelling in the area is still quite normal, especially if the procedure was complex due to the close proximity to the nerve. However, if the swelling doesn't subside, becomes notably worse, or if you develop other signs of infection like fever or intense pain, it is very important to contact your surgeon right away.\n\nAs always, although these are general guidelines, nothing beats a physical examination in person. Therefore, I would advise you to discuss your concern with your oral surgeon. Ensure to maintain good oral hygiene and follow all post-operative instructions given by your dentist. Don't forget to rinse your mouth with warm salt water 2-3 times per day, which can help reduce inflammation\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your information.

It was my first intercourse with a sex worker and I am worrying about expose to HIV. I have started fearing from the minute where I had broken condom intercourse and she said to me that she does not have HIV and they never allow anyone to have sex without a condom because of fear of getting infected. So there is no need to worry but I cannot believe her and started studying about HIV and its symptoms and I have a feeling of infection because I got red dots in my finger pits and cold and throat infection.I want to know what are the red dots on my finger which I got? I got it tested many times in those three months and got a negative result. I am worrying abt six months test.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYou are right to be cautious, as unprotected sex does put you at a higher risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. It's good that you've been testing regularly and currently have negative results.\n\nThe little red spots on your fingers may not necessarily be related to HIV. They could be caused by many things like dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, allergies, or even stress. However, it would be difficult for me to confirm without physically seeing them. You should consult with a dermatologist if these dots persist or develop further symptoms.\n\nCold and throat infection can also come from common viruses and not necessarily linked to HIV. If tested negative multiple times within the three-month window period, it is very likely you are HIV-negative. Current tests are extremely accurate at this point.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that few type of HIV tests will need six months time to detect antibodies. Hence, it is advised to get tested after 6 months as per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation. It's important that you continue to protect yourself moving forward. Your sexual health is crucial so always use protection to reduce the risk of STI transmission. \n\nWhatever the circumstances, you should see your healthcare provider to discuss about your symptoms and concerns. Anytime you engage in high-risk behavior and concerns arise - seek medical help immediately.\n\nRemember that there are medications available called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which can drastically reduce the chance of contracting HIV if started within\n\n## Output (b):\nDo you have any symptoms now other than red dots in your finger?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on the results of your CT scan, it seems like your situation is under control. The small size of these nodules (3 mm and 4 mm), as well as their non-aggressive appearance on imaging, strongly suggest they are benign (non-cancerous). Intrathoracic nodules, such as intrapulmonary lymph nodes or lung nodules, can appear for many reasons other than cancer, including infection, inflammation, or even normal anatomic variations.\n\nThe finding of \"mild thymic hyperplasia\" also suggests a non-malignant process; the thymus sometimes enlarges in response to stress, illness, or normal hormonal changes depending on age.\n\nWhile it's completely understandable that you might find this concerning, at this stage, the appropriate course of action usually involves monitoring rather than aggressive treatment. This would typically involve follow-up CT scans at intervals recommended by a radiologist or pulmonologist to ensure there's no significant growth or change in these nodules.\n\nHowever, remember, this advice is based on limited information and should not replace the advice of your own physicians who have full access to your medical records. Stick with your doctors' plan, but don\u2019t hesitate to ask them more questions if you\u2019re feeling unsure about anything.\n\n## Output (b):\n Did you do any research into your symptoms?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThere are various reasons why your period might be late other than pregnancy. Stress and anxiety can cause changes in your menstrual cycle. Excessive exercise, rapid weight loss or gain, hormonal issues like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid dysfunction can also make your periods irregular. Certain medications including contraceptive pills can alter your cycle too.\n\nSometimes having sex for the first time may induce stress or fear of being pregnant which can result in a delayed period even if you had the negative pregnancy test.\n\nHowever, if this continues to be an issue, it would be best to follow up with your gynecologist for further evaluation. Also, consider using reliable contraception methods if you wish to avoid unwanted pregnancies.\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your answer.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nPhenol, also known as carbolic acid, is a corrosive substance which can cause harm if ingested or in contact with skin. Based on the symptoms your friend has shown (vomiting), it indicates that phenol could have affected his gastrointestinal tract.\n\nContinued symptoms to watch for would include abdominal pain, diarrhea, burns or blisters around the mouth, difficulty swallowing/breathing, dizziness/fainting, and changes in heart rate. Skin exposure can also result in burns, so clean any areas that might've come into contact with phenol with mild soap and water.\n\nThe actions taken so far (vomiting and drinking lots of salty water) in an attempt to mitigate the effects are not recommended without medical supervision since they bring about their own potential risks such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. \n\nAt this point due to the potential severity of phenol poisoning, I highly recommend seeking immediate emergency medical attention even though he vomited after ingestion.

Last week I had brown discharge with mild lower abdominal pain and was prescribed Susten 200 mg (oral). Now, I am feeling the pain frequently in the right lower abdomen with mild bleeding and pain. It is less when I lie on bed. What to do?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms of abdominal pain, mild bleeding, and a recent ultrasound without visible fetal or yolk sac could potentially be suggestive of an early pregnancy complication such as threatened miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy especially should be ruled out due to right lower abdominal pain; it is a condition where the fetus begins to develop outside the uterus, often in a fallopian tube. \n\nWhile Susten 200mg (progesterone) may be administered for threatened abortion or to support early pregnancy, it doesn't eliminate risk completely and not effective against ectopic pregnancies.\n\nThis requires immediate medical attention. You need to see your healthcare provider urgently or consider going to the emergency department. They will probably order blood tests and possibly repeat the ultrasound to monitor your condition closely. Please do not ignore these symptoms and seek help immediately.\n\n## Output (b):\n What medications are you currently taking?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I believe I may be more vulnerable than the average person my age to get Coronavirus, due to my weakened immune system? Should I be self isolating? I am ok to do so\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIf you're living in an area affected by COVID-19, it's prudent to take extra precautions due to your health history and underlying autoimmune condition. This includes practicing good hygiene such as washing your hands regularly, avoiding large gatherings if possible, maintaining social distance from people who are sick, and wearing a mask when necessary. \n\nGiven your medical history, you potentially could be at a higher risk for severe illness if you do contract the virus, so self-isolating can be one measure to reduce exposure. However, not everyone needs to self-isolate unless recommended or required based on travel history, exposure to infected individuals, or showing symptoms of being sick. Please consult with your healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.\n\nIn addition to following general protective measures against the virus, remember to manage your Hashimoto\u2019s disease well, which typically includes taking your medication as prescribed, attending all necessary check-ups, eating healthily, and exercising regularly.\n\nThese recommendations are based on current public health guidelines and may change as more is learned about the virus.

My last ferritin level was 342, 20 days back. My ferritin level has been as high as 390. My TIBC, UIBC, iron, and iron saturation have always been within normal range. My glucose has always ranged from 100 to 104. I was tested for hemochromatosis and results are negative. My doctors keep telling me that we will just watch my ferritin level and I have bloodwork done every six months. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year. I am looking for some answers and some help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nFerritin is a protein that stores iron in your body, and the ferritin test measures the amount of ferritin in your blood. Normally, as you stated, high ferritin levels can indicate conditions where your body stores too much iron. Hemochromatosis is one such condition, but you mention being tested for this with negative results.\n\nElevated ferritin levels can also occur due to inflammation, liver disease, malignant diseases, or other chronic disorders. Since you are diagnosed with fibromyalgia - which is a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body - this could be contributing to your elevated ferritin levels. \n\nHowever, only your healthcare provider who understands your history and clinical profile will be able to piece together these puzzle pieces. Moreover, ferritin can increase depending upon lifestyle factors too like alcohol intake, diet, physical activity levels, etc.\n\nAlso, mildly elevated glucose levels might indicate impaired fasting glucose (pre-diabetes). Please try to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent type 2 diabetes: regular exercise, normal weight, balanced food choices are always recommended.\n\nPlease consult your doctor about any changes in your medical condition or new symptoms.\n\n## Output (b):\n What about your family?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection caused by an imbalance in the normal bacteria found in your vagina. It's true that if left untreated, it can lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, it causing infertility directly is less common. That being said, it is still important to treat BV.\n\nIf standard treatments like Metronidazole or Clindamycin are not working for you, you should certainly revisit your doctor who may explore other treatment options. Refractory BV sometimes requires long-term or recurrent treatments. Don't hesitate to include natural alternatives under supervision, such as probiotics which have been shown to help reestablish healthy vaginal flora.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining excellent genital hygiene might be helpful \u2013 clean your external genital area gently with mild unscented soap, avoid douching, avoid irritants like bubble baths, sprays etc., and ensure underwear are always clean and dry.\n\nYou should also get regularly tested for STIs since having BV may increase your susceptibility to them. Lastly, implementing safe sex practices would be beneficial too, as new sexual partners can alter the bacterial balance in your vagina.\n\nRemember none of this constitutes direct medical advice. It\u2019s crucial you continue discussing your concerns and symptoms face-to-face with your treating physician as they'll provide guidance based on direct examination, tests, and broader medical history.\n\n## Output (b):\n It might be best to start with a general question.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Initially, it used to happen only in winter 4 to 5 years back and then gradually started in rainy days also. Now in summer also while sweating. It is so irritating like that I am going to be mad. I have stopped using soap and also took Clonafit 0.25 mg and Betonix- 10 prescribed by a dermatologist but there is no improvement. Please help me out of this.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like you might be experiencing a condition called aquagenic pruritus or cholinergic urticaria - both of these conditions can cause itching after exposure to water (like after showering) or when the body heats up (like during exercise, resulting in sweating). Aquagenic pruritus and cholinergic urticaria are conditions that often benefit from proper moisturization, anti-itch creams, oral antihistamines, or even prescription medication in more severe cases. \n\nHowever, bear in mind it is crucial to get a year-round, confirmed diagnosis first. I would recommend seeing a dermatologist for an examination if you have not had one recently so that they may confirm exactly what is going on. They may want to perform an allergy test and may also check your liver and kidney function with blood tests as diseases of these organs can sometimes manifest this way. It's important to explore other possibilities such as other types of dermatitis, scabies, thyroid issues, among others. If possible, take note of what seems to trigger the itching and how long it lasts which could provide clues about its source.\n\nRemember, only use medications based on doctor advice and apply a hypoallergenic moisturizer to your skin immediately after getting out of the bath while your skin is still damp. This helps lock in moisture and provides a protective barrier. Additionally, consider using a gentle soap-free cleanser, cool bathing water instead of hot, reduce the duration of your baths/showers, and\n\n## Output (b):\n Please specify the following about the patient's symptoms:\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I'd like to assure you that feeling worried and anxious about these symptoms is perfectly normal. According to your description, it seems you've been thoroughly examined by several doctors and specialists who have ruled out heart conditions and other obvious causes for your discomfort.\n\nThe symptoms you're describing - facial tightness, chest burning sensation, the fact they are relief temporarily by food, alcohol, lying down, or exercising - do not immediately point to one clear diagnosis. Anxiety can indeed create physical manifestations that are very real and sometimes medical tests cannot detect this because it's linked to our nervous system responding to stress.\n\nMusculoskeletal issues (such as tension in the muscles of the neck, shoulders, which then manifests itself on face) could also be plausible especially if you're under a lot of stress or have poor posture. Acid reflux or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) could explain both chest burning and potentially facial discomfort, given its chronic nature, but would usually accompany other gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nOne important thing is that you noticed a decrease in intensity over time, which might suggest improvement. My advice would be to follow up with your primary care physician, continue to monitor the symptoms and their triggers, consider psychological counseling to help manage any potential anxiety, and perhaps investigate more into gastroenterological or musculoskeletal possibilities. If symptoms persist or worsen, further diagnostic testing might be warranted. This is just an opinion based on your description, please consult with your healthcare provider for definitive diagnosis and\n\n## Output (b):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of related to this issue?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

She had been treated for TB (tuberculosis) of the abdomen as her ultrasound of abdomen finding was thicken bowel loop. In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition. But, her neuro problem of numbness in her legs and loss of sensation in legs still continues. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear about the distressing medical situation with your mother. Your mother's clinical case seems quite complicated and must have been overseen by multiple specialized physicians. It sounds like she may have developed peripheral neuropathy as a complication of her TB treatment, which can be caused by certain anti-tuberculosis medications. Her back pain could be due to the compression injury in spine.\n\nAlso, the use of steroids might have led to a rise in blood sugar levels causing the distress regarding breathlessness and hospital admission; this is something often seen in patients on long term steroid therapy. \n\nWhile I'd heavily advise to continue consulting her team of doctors regarding the current status and necessary adjustment of her treatments, considering her complaints of persistent numbness and loss of sensation in legs, a neurological consultation is clearly recommended right away. This condition could be due to several reasons including nerve damage from her TB or its treatment, adverse effect of other medications, diabetes which may have further exacerbated due to steroid usage, or even nutritional deficiencies. A neurologist will do the detailed examination and also decide if any investigations like Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) are necessary.\n\nTake note that controlling her blood sugar levels frequently would be an important part of managing her symptoms as high sugar levels tend to make neuropathic symptoms worse. If arthritis diagnosed, physical therapy along with medication aid could improvise locomotion and relieve some discomfort. \n\nIn complex cases such as these, communication among all her treating physicians is key so the\n\n## Output (b):\n Did you also see a dermatologist?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I was given Amoxicillin for five days and Prednisone 5 mg. My ENT doctor examined my ears and told me that there was no issue with the eardrum. He diagnosed it as eustachian tube issue. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHello,\n\nGiven your current symptoms and past medical history, it sounds like you may be experiencing a similar episode of Eustachian tube dysfunction possibly related to a cold or sinus infection. \n\nEustachian tubes can get blocked due to inflammation from allergies, colds, sinus infections, etc., which might lead to feelings of pressure, fullness or clogging in the ear. Your current treatment with Afrin (a decongestant nasal spray) and Sudafed (an oral decongestant), is generally recommended for managing such conditions.\n\nHowever, if your symptoms persist or worsen, I suggest that you consult with your ENT doctor again. They might want to repeat the use of antibiotics like Amoxicillin if they suspect there is an active underlying infection, or even corticosteroids like Prednisone to alleviate inflammation.

Our first kid is just 1 year old now and it was a Cesarean. We are not in a position to have a second child now. Her LMP was 22nd of last month. I read that Mifepristone can induce abortion. Is it a safe drug? Do we have to consult doctor for taking this drug? What are all the possible side effects? Is that drug 100 percent reliable? Is there any other options? Whether this drug is available without doctor\\s prescription? Thank you.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I cannot recommend inducing an abortion without your wife seeing a healthcare professional. \n\nMifepristone used in combination with misoprostol is commonly used for medical abortions but it should only be taken under the guidance and supervision of a qualified health care provider due to potential complications. The safety and efficacy of this medication largely depend on the gestational age, the dose, and how it's administrated.\n\nSide effects can include heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea among others. While complications are rare, they do exist and can be life-threatening including severe bleeding or infection. \n\nFurthermore, Mifepristone's effectiveness rate is not 100%. On its own, mifepristone is less effective; thus, it is usually given in combine with misoprostol. Together, they are about 95 - 98% effective when administered correctly up until the 10th week of pregnancy.\n\nMoreover, in many countries, Mifepristone and other drugs that induce abortion are typically regulated medicines, which means they must be prescribed by a licensed healthcare provider after determining that the use of these medications is safe and appropriate for the individual patient's situation.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that using this type of medication without consulting her doctor first can lead to significant health risks. Your best option is to consult with your family doctor or gynecologist who can guide you with safe methods taking into account your wife's general health and specific condition.\n\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Where do you live?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My mother is 50 years old. She complains of episodic, sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon. This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother. She has a history of menorrhagia and cycles have become more irregular now. Then, diagnostic D and C was performed last year, which was normal. She will not smoke or drink. She sleeps 4 to 6 hours daily and snores at night.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your description, it seems like your mother is experiencing a multitude of symptoms. The sudden loss of weight bearing ability in the left Achilles tendon indicating some weakness or potential damage which can result from inadequate blood flow, nerve damage or inflammation from diseases such as arthritis and potentially an effects of age.\n\nThe knee and hip pain with swelling could be due to her osteoarthritis or possibly other form of arthritis. Difficulty in movement further indicates this condition causing joint stiffness and immobility.\n\nHer hypertension is reportedly controlled, but she should continue taking her prescribed medication (Bisoprolol and Amlodipine). The kidney stones may be a cause of her lumbar area pain; depending on the size and location of the stones, treatment options may vary.\n\nThe occasional constipation could be related to her diet or potentially certain medications.\n\nYour mother's gynecological history suggests hormonal fluctuations especially with irregular menstrual cycles. This requires close monitoring considering the family's history of uterine cancer.\n\nFor her sleep pattern, if there are signs of distress like difficulty breathing or momentary stops in breathing during snoring, they might suggest presence of conditions like sleep apnea, which would need evaluation.\n\nGiven this complex health scenario, I recommend having a detailed consultation with your mother's primary care provider who can guide you for specialist consultations if required. Please make sure she continues her current medications, maintains adequate hydration and follows a balanced diet. She should also get regular exercise as tolerated considering her joint issues.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Does your mother have any other medical conditions?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Soon into using the drugs I developed headaches, dizziness, and nausea. I changed the type of PPI three times but the symptoms persisted. The symptoms included a feeling of pressure above my right ear and behind my right eye. Later, I came off the PPIs and after using over the counter headache painkillers for three days the severity of the headaches eased. But the feeling of pressure remains to this day on the right side of the face. I often feel heavy head or even light-headed with a slight dizziness, often as if I am hung over. The symptoms come and go, but are there every day for differing periods of time. And the constant is this feeling of slight pressure on the right side of my head above the ear and extending sometimes down to the cheek and behind the right eye.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe symptoms you're describing are consistent with a condition known as a tension headache. Tension headaches result from muscle contractions in the head and neck region, and they can present as pressure right above your ear and behind your eye. It could possibly be triggered by certain medications including PPIs.\n\nHowever, tension headache is just one possibility. There may be other causes like sinus issues which also present with pressure feeling on face and head. Anxiety and stress can also cause similar symptoms. \n\nSince you mentioned these symptoms persist after stopping the PPIs and also because they seem to come and go every day, I would advise you to consult with a neurologist to ensure that there isn't any serious underlying issue such as migraines, or neuralgia etc. \n\nFor now, try relaxation techniques and avoiding stress as much as possible. Stay hydrated and maintain a regular sleep schedule. Remember, it's crucial to seek professional medical advice for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment. These suggestions are made based on your descriptions, but are only meant as general guidance.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n In the past, have you had any medical conditions or operations?

He has no bad breath and he was able to have normal food. Can people with trench mouth have no bad breath and is able to eat normal food?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nTrench mouth, also known as acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), is a severe form of gum disease characterized by painful, infected, bleeding gums and ulcers. Key symptoms often include bad breath (halitosis) and pain upon eating.\n\nHowever, bear in mind that not all individuals with ANUG will necessarily exhibit all symptoms to the same degree. For instance, some people may still be able to eat normally without experiencing significant discomfort, and not everyone with ANUG has noticeably bad breath. \n\nAlso remember that these symptoms are not exclusive to trench mouth; they could indicate other oral health issues too. But regarding your partner's case specifically, if he doesn't have any noticeable symptoms such as painful or bleeding gums, ulcers, or fever, it seems unlikely he has trench mouth. \n\nNonetheless, even without obvious signs, if you suspect there may be a problem, it's best for him to get a check-up with a dentist who can properly diagnose his condition.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Is the patient a man?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22. So everyone on my side of the family has thyroid issues. We were wondering if you could please give us some guidance. Looking to see if we need to eliminate thyroid as a possible cause of his symptoms or if it is worth further pursuit.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nGiven the persistent symptoms and family history of thyroid conditions, it would be wise to further investigate this with an endocrinologist. Even though his blood work came back normal, it's important to remember that the reference ranges for TSH, free T3, and free T4 are quite broad and values within lower or upper limits of the normal range may not be optimal for everybody.\n\nMoreover, as you've indicated his urine test showed low iodine and selenium levels - both elements which are crucial for proper thyroid functioning. Selenium deficiency alone can promote autoimmunity in the context of genetic predisposition, which is relevant considering your family history. \n\nThe possibility of low iodine due to diet and its effect on masking signs of hyperthyroidism is unlikely. Low iodine intake generally leads to hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism because iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. If there was a long-standing severe iodine deficiency, you could potentially see hyperthyroidism when iodine is reintroduced, but this typically happens under very specific circumstances (such as public health efforts to correct severe population-wide iodine deficiency).\n\nSince his fear of doctors might exacerbate existing anxiety, perhaps telehealth visits can help alleviate some of this stress while still providing him necessary medical attention. We should also not overlook the possibility that his symptoms may indeed be panic related, since anxiety disorders can mimic many physical disease processes. Hence, along with endocrine evaluation, psychological assessment could also be considered useful\n\n## Output (b):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of about your son's condition?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

There is a possibility that the discomfort and blocked sensation might be psychological in nature due to stress from the incident, rather than physical. \n\nYou should flush out your nose with saline solution to wash out any residue or foreign substances which could alleviate the blockage.  \nHowever, to rule out anything serious or to further evaluate what exactly might be causing these feelings I would recommend you see an ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat) specialist. They may need to perform an endoscopy (a procedure where they insert a small tube with a light and camera on the end to check inside your nose) to ensure there are no foreign bodies or injury within the nasal cavity.\n\nPlease also seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe pain, swelling, difficulty breathing or swallowing, rash, profuse bleeding or have any other concerns.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Please answer the question regarding the patient's smoking and drinking habits.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Sometimes they occur on my face when I masturbate. If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result.Is it okay to continue this?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nMometasone is a potent steroid that can lead to serious side effects if used inappropriately. Long-term use of this medication may thin or damage the skin and possibly cause other more serious internal side effects. It's not typically used for acne treatment.\n\nFor treating acne, strategies will depend on the type and severity of your acne, as well as your type of skin. This can involve over-the-counter creams and ointments, prescription drugs, or medical procedures. Hormonal changes, such as those experienced during puberty and menstruation, as well as stress, can stimulate sebum production and thereby potentially exacerbate acne. Masturbation does not scientifically cause acne but stress might.\n\nIt's highly recommended to consult with a dermatologist who can provide advice and may be able to prescribe you with more suitable treatments for acne like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids, azelaic acid, or prescription medications like antibiotics.\n\nRemember, don't pick at your acne or wash your face excessively as these actions can actually make conditions worse. Eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water, and maintaining a consistent skincare routine can also help manage your acne.\n\n## Output (b):\n The doctor will be notified once you complete this questionnaire.

It is like a soft pulpy thing. Right now it is small and not causing much pain. When she works too much, she feels a weight on her shoulder and a mild pain like she has lifted a weight. Is that something cancerous?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nWithout an examination and further investigations, it's difficult to definitively diagnose your mother's condition. However, what you're describing could be a lipoma, which is a benign (non-cancerous) soft tissue growth composed of fat cells. Lipomas are usually painless unless they press on a nerve or have blood vessels running through them but can cause discomfort if they grow large.\n\nHowever, there can be other possibilities too. It's important that she see a doctor in person for a proper assessment. They might recommend imaging tests like ultrasound or MRI, and possibly a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Always take lumps and bumps seriously, especially if they change in size, shape or become painful.

My problem is the teeth has become white for the past few years. The back portion of the teeth has become dark or black. Teeth are quite creamy. Often a bad smell spreads out from my mouth. My mother also suffers from this problem. I use whitening toothpaste but all are in vain. So, please doctor help me and give me a suggestion.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your symptoms, it appears you may be suffering from dental decay or caries, which is a bacterial infection of teeth. The black discoloration can occur as the result of consumption of certain foods and drinks (like coffee, tea, cola), tobacco use, inadequate brushing and flossing, or due to a buildup of tartar. \n\nHere are few suggestions:\n\n1. Good oral hygiene: Brush your teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste and floss once a day.\n2. Cut down on sugar: Sugar feeds the bacteria in your mouth, causing it to produce acids that erode enamel and lead to cavities.\n3. Regular dental check-ups: Visit a dentist every 6 months for professional cleaning and check-up.\n4. Balanced diet: Maintain a healthy, balanced diet and drink plenty of water to keep your mouth hydrated and discourage bacterial growth.\n\nSince your mother also suffers from this issue, there could be a genetic component. Oral health problems can sometimes run in families, so both of you should prioritize good oral care habits and regular dental visits.\n\nBad breath can simply be caused by the food we eat, smoking, dry mouth, medical conditions, gum disease, and sinus conditions. Poor oral hygiene can also make you more prone to bad breath.\n\nRegarding whitening toothpaste, they mostly remove surface stains and do not change the inherent color of your teeth. Using abrasive toothpastes excessively can also wear away your enamel over time. Do continue using fluoride toothpaste though as\n\n## Output (b):\n What would you like to know, Patient?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

We visited a pediatrician who suggested a dermatologist consultation. I have attached images of the rashes and the prescription. We noticed that it increases in the evenings. Every morning he wakes up with clear skin and during evenings it worsens. He had a fever for two days around the same time it started. He keeps scratching himself. The severity has reduced, but it is not completely gone.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on the provided information, your child's symptoms could indicate a variety of conditions, ranging from certain types of dermatitis, hives due to an allergic reaction, or even a viral rash such as roseola particularly since you mentioned an accompanied fever. However, without physically examining your child and looking at his patient history in detail, it is hard for me to determine what might be causing the rashes. \n\nPlease make sure that you are following any guidelines that your pediatrician offered in terms of helping alleviate the itching sensation - this could mean using certain moisturizers, keeping him cool as heat might worsen the itchiness, or over-the-counter antihistamines (please do consult with the pharmacist/doctor before giving these to your son). \n\nThe need of further intervention and management depends on whether the situation improves gradually. Also check if there are any new foods, detergents, clothes materials which he has been introduced recently. If anything that potentially can cause allergy should be stopped for now.\n\nLastly, please proceed with the dermatologist consultation as suggested by your pediatrician who might run some tests or take a skin sample (biopsy) to better understand the rash.\n\n## Output (b):\n What do you know about your child's medical history?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am worried.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe choice to treat a fracture with casting, ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation), or buddy taping depends on the location of the fracture, its displacement, instability and involvement of joint. Based on your description, it seems like you have an intra-articular fracture of your fifth metacarpal which is displaced significantly.\n\nGiven these specifics, I understand why you'd be concerned about only having a buddy tape in place instead of a cast or strap. The goal of treatment in these scenarios is often to align the bones so they heal accurately. Buddy taping alone might not provide sufficient realignment and stabilization for a considerably ulnarly-displaced intraarticular fracture. And waiting for the clinic can increase the risk of malunion, where the bone heals incorrectly leading to potential long-term disability, discomfort, and decreased hand functionality. \n\nHowever, without examining you personally or reviewing your images directly, it's difficult for me to give precise advice. What you should do right now is reach out immediately to the medical team already involved in your care. Let them know your pain level, any changes to your symptoms, and your concerns about non-surgical management. It would also be advisable to get a second opinion if possible.\n\nBut regardless, ensure that you're keeping your hand elevated to help reduce swelling, icing it regularly to decrease pain, and avoiding any activities that could further injure the area while you wait.\n\n## Output (b):\n Do you have a fracture?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

It lasted for about four to five days. She then got dengue and on the 14th of this month, had mild spotting for a day and a half. The doctor said it could be the dengue causing the spotting. She has not gotten her periods yet. I have read that there could be bleeding during pregnancy as well.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nA lack of menstruation can be for a variety of reasons. Dengue fever could, in theory, affect a menstrual cycle due to the body being under stress. The spotting that your fianc\u00e9e experienced could also be related to the disease or its treatment.\n\nThat being said, it is equally possible that pregnancy could be causing these symptoms. Both implantation bleeding (which often occurs around the time of a woman's expected period and can sometimes be mistaken for a lighter-than-usual period) and changes in cervical bleeding can cause light vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy. \n\nOther causes of delayed or missed periods include high levels of stress, significant changes in weight, hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions, changes in medication etc.\n\nIt is important for your fianc\u00e9e to see a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis if she doesn't get her periods soon and especially if you both have been sexually active with no contraceptive use. A simple pregnancy test can quickly provide clarity. Please seek immediate medical attention if she experiences severe pain or heavy bleeding.\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your question.

It is only noticeable when I close my left eye, and so I am not sure how long it has taken for this to develop. I am going to see an optometrist and doctor early next week but am currently on the road for work.My main question is that when I look out of the corner of my right eye the blurriness seems to subside and I can see usually. I am wondering if this is a good sign. I have been dealing with severe anxiety the past couple months, and I am worried that might have raised my blood pressure enough to hurt my eyesight.Eyesight when looking with both eyes seems to be normal. I have also noticed floaters in my eyes. Kindly help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms could be due to a number of issues including refractive errors (like nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism), presbyopia (age-related vision changes), dry eye condition, migraines, or retinal conditions. Anxiety can cause physical symptoms, but it wouldn't typically affect eyesight in this way.\n\nWhile it's good that the blurriness seems to subside when looking out of the corner of your eye, that doesn't really give much clinical information about the potential underlying issue. It's important to see an optometrist who can more precisely evaluate your visual acuity, as well as assess any possible medical concerns through a comprehensive eye exam.\n\nThe floaters you mentioned are fairly common and don't always indicate a serious problem. However, if you're seeing a lot of new floaters, or if they're accompanied by flashes of light or peripheral vision loss, then you should seek immediate medical attention as these can be signs of a retinal detachment.\n\nIn the meantime, try not to strain your eyes, take breaks from screens, maintain good lighting when reading or working, and avoid rubbing your eyes. If symptoms worsen before your scheduled appointment, I recommend seeking earlier medical attention.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is it painful?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am 70 kg, 5\\3\" feet.I am currently experiencing shortness of breath, it started a week ago and never went away even though I am taking lagundi or herbal cough medicine 500 mg three times a day after meal.I also feel like I have a lot of phlegm that I cannot release. It just feels heavy on my right chest that passes through my back. I am having paranoia on having COVID-19, but I am afraid to get checked because I might actually get it from the hospital. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's understandable you would be concerned given the current COVID-19 pandemic. The symptoms you described - shortness of breath, chest heaviness, also cough with phlegm - can be seen in various conditions such as pneumonia(including the one caused by COVID 19), bronchitis, and even certain heart problems.\n\nConsidering your age, if you don't have any chronic health conditions and are otherwise generally healthy, acute respiratory infections like bronchitis could be a common cause for these symptoms. However, it's important to rule out COVID-19 considering its prevalence especially if you've had recent contact with someone who tested positive or have traveled to an area with high case numbers.\n\nRemember that diagnosis should not be avoided due to fear of contracting the illness at the hospital. Most healthcare providers have instituted protocols to prevent transmission among their patients. You should call ahead to let them know about your situation so they can guide you appropriately avoiding unnecessary exposures.\n\nWhile you wait to see a doctor, monitor your symptoms closely. If your condition worsens (difficulty breathing becomes severe, persistent chest pain, confusion, bluish lips/face), please seek immediate medical attention as these are signs of an emergency.\n \nKeep in mind this advice is based on the information you provided, and the physician examining you may form different conclusion based upon physical examination and further investigations.\n\n## Output (b):\n Do you know if the patient has any medical conditions?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have a sufficient space for it to grow, and it is growing straight. I do not have pain in the tooth and half of the tooth is poking out now. But I have trouble in opening my mouth fully.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt seems like you might be experiencing a condition known as Pericoronitis. This is an inflammation of the gum tissue that often occurs when a wisdom tooth (also known as third molar) partially erupts but leaves a flap of gum covering part of the tooth, where food can become trapped and cause a localized infection.\n\nDifficulty in opening your mouth could be due to the swelling associated with this condition, or it could be a symptom of Trismus - a restriction to mouth opening as a result of masticatory muscle or joint inflammation or damage, often linked to dental infections or procedures.\n\nWhile waiting for appointment with a dentist, some measures such as good oral hygiene including brushing and flossing regularly, using a warm salt water rinse several times a day, and over-the-counter pain relievers could potentially help ease these symptoms. Please do not delay seeing a dental professional since untreated pericoronitis can lead to serious complications such as spread of infection. They'll be able to definitively diagnose your issue and provide appropriate treatment options.\n\nPlease note: this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation.

I had two I-pills in one month. After the first I-pill, I got withdrawal bleeding after five days. It lasted for four days and the flow was normal. After 14 days of this incident, I again had protected sexual intercourse and took another I-pill after 36 hours. But this time even after 11 days, there is no withdrawal bleeding. Is this because of hormonal imbalance or pregnancy?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe emergency contraceptive pill, or \"morning-after pill,\" contains hormones that can prevent pregnancy by delaying ovulation or preventing fertilization. It is common to experience alterations in your menstrual cycle after taking the I-pill due to its hormonal impact. These changes can include spotting, early periods, late periods, or even missed periods.\n\nIt's difficult to say for certain whether the lack of withdrawal bleeding this time around is due to a hormonal imbalance caused by taking two I-pills within a month, or if it could possibly indicate pregnancy. Given that you had protected sex and took an emergency contraceptive, the chances should be relatively low, but no method is 100% effective. \n\nI would recommend doing a home pregnancy test for your peace of mind. If the test comes out negative and you still don't get your period, consider seeing a healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms/condition. Remember, repeated use of emergency contraception can lead to irregular cycles and unpredictable bleeding patterns. They are not recommended as a regular form of contraception despite their effectiveness. It would be useful to talk about more consistent forms of birth control with your doctor.\n\n## Output (b):\n What is your answer?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Is it advisable to wait for one month to be seen by my gynecologist or go to an urgent care right away?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nRecurrent vaginal discharge could be due to a persistent infection or other underlying conditions. It's notable that antibiotics can sometimes lead to a yeast infection as they eliminate not only harmful bacteria but also some of the good bacteria in your vagina, allowing for an overgrowth of yeast. \n\nIf you are experiencing discomfort, itching, or other symptoms along with the discharge, it would be advisable to see a healthcare provider sooner rather than later. You don't necessarily have to go to urgent care, unless the symptoms are severe or unmanageable, but you should definitely try to see a physician more immediately than waiting out the whole month.\n\nHowever, if there are no other troublesome symptoms and the condition isn't affecting your daily life, it might be okay to monitor the situation while waiting for your gynecologist's appointment. Make sure to maintain adequate personal hygiene, wearing loose fitting, cotton underwear and avoid using scented soaps or feminine sprays until your appointment.\n\nPlease remember this advice is quite general.

Then had two heart valves repaired and they want to put a stent in. His list of medications does not seem to make sense and although he loves his cardiologist. I do not think he is paying enough attention. I am in the medical field and although I am not a pharmacist or an M.D. I know a little bit about adverse drug reactions. Tell me if this makes sense to you.Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg half pill twice a day, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq once daily, Losartan potassium 25 mg once daily, Warfarin sodium 5 mg once daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg, Digozin 25 mcg once daily and Furosemide 40 mg once daily.I need to know if these medications are fine to take all in one day and if so, I would like to split them into two times a day according to the reactions. I feel that so many medications doing the same thing is redundant and unnecessary and causing problems. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe medications listed are fairly typical for someone with a heart attack, stroke and heart valve disease. They each have different roles:\n\n1. Metoprolol tartrate: This is a beta blocker which is used to lower blood pressure, but also slows down the heart rate and decreases the work on the heart.\n2. Potassium Chloride: This is often prescribed due to the effects other medications like Lasix (Furosemide) can have on lowering potassium levels in the body. Maintaining a healthy potassium level is important for normal heart rhythms.\n3. Losartan potassium: This is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) effective at blood vessel dilation and relieving high blood pressure. \n4. Warfarin sodium: This is an anticoagulant (\u201cblood thinner\u201d) used to maintain a somewhat 'thinner' blood consistency to minimize risk of clots leading to further stroke or heart attack.\n5. Atorvastatin (a \u201cstatin\u201d): Used to lower cholesterol and prevent build up of plaque on arterial walls.\n6. Digoxin: Helps control irregular heartbeat and reduces symptoms of heart failure.\n7. Furosemide: A diuretic generally used to eliminate excessive fluid retention especially in heart failure situations.\n\nAppending to that, taking all these medications in one day isn't likely to cause harm in itself, but they each do need to be taken as directed, because some interact with others.

Keep in mind not to self-medicate as it can potentially worsen your condition. Also, remember not to put anything into your ears (like cotton swabs) trying to clean, because you might push the infection deeper or perforate your eardrum accidentally.\n\nIn the meantime, maintaining good hygiene by washing the outer part of your ear with mild soap and water, avoiding swimming pools, and not using headphones or hearing aids until the infection has cleared up completely are recommended.

Basically, I break out when the climate I am in is hot, or when I exercise. I visited my family doctor and he told me to get a blood test and he also gave me a Cetirizine (Zyrtec) prescription which is 20 mg. I have been taking this medication for about four days now, and I still get these itchy hives. If I were to get a blood test, will the doctor be able to prescribe the right medication, so I can get rid of these annoying hives?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's important to continue with the prescribed medication even if you don't see immediate results. It can take up to several weeks for certain medications, including antihistamines like Cetirizine, to fully control symptoms.\n\nThe blood test your doctor ordered will likely help determine whether there may be an underlying cause for your chronic urticaria. Some possible causes include autoimmune diseases, infections, or other allergies. Knowing the root cause of your hives will aid in tailoring the most effective treatment plan.\n\nIf the Zyrtec continues to not alleviate your symptoms after a couple weeks, revisit your doctor so they can adjust your dosage or recommend a different kind of medication altogether. In more severe cases, doctors might consider prescribing H2 blockers or leukotriene antagonists. Corticosteroids could also be used in short courses for extreme flare-ups; however, long-term use is generally avoided due to potential side effects.\n\nIn addition, I'd encourage you to try identify and avoid triggering factors that contribute towards your hives - e.g., heat, certain foods, stress etc. This, along with the right medication, should help you manage your chronic urticaria better.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the most common time of day for the symptoms to occur?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

But as it is not showing any problem so I left it till now. But now I want to go for hydrocele surgery. Also, I want to know any other methods except surgery which can be done to finish hydrocele. Now I am also going to gym and doing some physical exercise there. Is there any problem with it? My age is 27 years, height is 5\\10\" and weight is 83 kg.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nA hydrocele is a type of swelling in the scrotum that occurs when fluid collects in the thin sheath surrounding a testicle. Hydroceles are usually painless and often don't require treatment. However, if you've decided to opt for surgery, it's generally considered safe and effective.\n\nOptions besides surgery can include watching and waiting or aspiration and sclerotherapy. With monitoring, as long as they aren't causing discomfort, there's not typically any problem with leaving them untreated. Aspiration and sclerotherapy involves drawing out the fluid with a needle and then injecting a chemical into the sac to prevent more fluid from accumulating. It isn't as widely used because it has higher rates of recurrence and complications compared to surgery.\n\nGoing to the gym and working out shouldn't be an issue with having a hydrocele, but certain exercises like those involving heavy weights, might increase intra-abdominal pressure and thus exacerbate the symptoms. So, while light exercises should be fine, do ensure to avoid heavy lifting.\n\nIn all scenarios, I recommend discussing this thoroughly with your healthcare provider who can properly evaluate you and provide advice tailored specifically to your condition.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please type anything else you want to tell the doctor.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Should I get worried about it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's important to understand that even protected sex with a stranger can run the risk of transmitting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially if there were any mishaps with the protection used. The inflammation in your urinary tract may be due to an STI or it might just be a simple Urinary Tract Infection (UTI).\n\nThis doesn't mean you should start worrying excessively, but you absolutely do need to seek medical attention as soon as possible. If it is indeed a UTI, these are usually easy to treat with antibiotics. However, if it turns out to be an STI, proper treatment is critical to avoid complications.\n\nIn the meantime, reduce discomfort by drinking plenty of water and avoiding irritants like coffee, alcohol and spicy foods.

I have taken unwanted 72 on the third day morning after having breakfast. But, still, my periods have not yet started. Can you please help me out with the reason behind that?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nEmergency contraceptives like Unwanted 72 can alter your menstrual cycle. This means after taking it, your next period could either start earlier or get delayed. The delay can be up to one week. If it's longer than a week or you have other symptoms (like nausea, breast tenderness), then you should take a pregnancy test to rule out the possibility of pregnancy.\n\nPlease note that emergency contraception pills should only be used as an emergency measure and not as a regular method of contraception. Regular unprotected sex carries risks of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unplanned pregnancies. Always use protection to maintain good reproductive health.

What does that mean or what could it be?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms may suggest a variety of gynecological conditions such as endometrial polyps, uterine fibroids, hormonal imbalances or potentially a miscarriage (if there's a chance you could have been pregnant). The passing of grey tissue could possibly be the lining of the uterus that has shed (endometrium) if it was not a miscarriage. This should not be taken lightly and I highly recommend seeing a healthcare provider soon in order to get an accurate diagnosis. They can guide you through any necessary tests such as blood tests, ultrasounds or other appropriate examinations based on their clinical judgement.\n\n## Output (b):\n Do you smoke?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

He has nasal blockage for the past two weeks. Now, he has developed a fever. His throat and tonsils are swollen. We took him to a doctor. The doctor prescribed him Benadryl 5 ml and Crocin DS 7.5 ml. He has not given any antibiotics. Is it fine? Please suggest.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe doctor's prescription of Benadryl and Crocin DS seems appropriate at this stage. Benadryl will help with his nasal blockage as it is a decongestant, and Crocin DS (which contains paracetamol) will help to reduce his fever.\n\nHowever, the persistence of symptoms for two weeks and the present swollen tonsils might indeed suggest a bacterial infection like strep throat, which would typically need an antibiotic for treatment. Sometimes, clinicians wait for symptoms to persist beyond a certain point before starting antibiotics.\n\nNevertheless, if your son's condition doesn't improve or worsens after few days of administering these medicines, I advise you revisit your pediatrician. They may reassess the situation and consider starting antibiotics if necessary. Also, make sure your kid rests and gets plenty of fluids.\n\n## Output (b):\n Was your son recently exposed to any cold or allergy?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I just woke up from a nap, and the vision in my left eye is blurry. It has not cleared up in the past half an hour. Twice over the years, this has happened, and it normalized over a few hours, but I am in a jungle now. So, I would like to err on the side of caution. I have had previous retinal detachments.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nSudden blurred vision in one eye could be a serious medical emergency considering your history of retinal detachments. Though it has resolved on its own in the past, you shouldn\u2019t rely on this happening again. The symptoms can indicate various conditions from less dangerous like dry eyes or refractive errors to potentially more severe conditions such as optic neuritis, macular degeneration, but in your case, it might signal a retinal detachment which is a significant concern and needs an immediate evaluation by an eye specialist.\n\nWithout having proper tools and clinical examination at hand I advise you to protect your vision by lowering physical activity, avoid bending down and certainly no heavy lifting. Keep your head up, at heart level generally. Do not rub your eyes too. \n\nI would strongly advise that you seek urgent professional medical assistance as soon as possible if you are able to leave the jungle or perhaps there's any possibility of communicating with services that may assist you in reaching a hospital urgently. It should not be taken lightly given your medical history and current context.\n\n## Output (b):\n Hello, Doctor, the patient's vision is cloudy and it is itchy.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My right hand and right shoulder directly hit the road and cause severe pain on the right side of the abdomen. A local doctor prescribed some medicine and I got relieved from my side pain. I went for an x-ray of the right chest, it was normal. But after 36 hours I am having pain in the right shoulder (scapula) and while sitting, or arising out of bed, or moving hand on the upper side the pain increases a lot. Is it normal or need better medical assistance?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nPain after a fall like yours is certainly not unusual. You may have bruised or strained the muscles and tissues around your right shoulder and scapula, which would explain the pain you're feeling, especially when moving in certain ways. \n\nHowever, given that the pain appears to be worsening or at least persisting after 36 hours, it's prudent to seek further medical evaluation. This could signify something more serious, such as a fracture which might not have been apparent on an X-ray at first due to swelling or inflammation, or a rotator cuff injury which would require specific physical therapy or possibly surgery.\n\nEven if there is no major damage, seeing a doctor could provide peace of mind and possible pain relief strategies such as physiotherapy or targeted exercises. Please get some professional help with this, particularly if the pain continues to increase or does not improve with rest and over-the-counter pain medications.\n\nAlso, consider watching for any signs of nerve injury such as weakness, numbness or tingling in your arm or hand.

This month: BG 110 mg/dl, GTT one hour 184 mg/dl, two hours 115 mg/dl, morning insulin 5.3 \\xce\\xbcU/ml. Every other blood test within normal ranges. I am male 32 years old 1.86 cm 93 kg 13 to 14 % body fat athletic with healthy nutrition habits. No history of diabetes in the family. Could I be having cancer in pancreas judging from the insulin values you are seeing? I have had many years to do a blood test and with this random one seven months ago. I was told by my doctor that I had to keep monitoring my blood glucose since I could develop diabetes later on, and since I have never had a problem with blood sugar as a kid and no family history of diabetes, I was wondering what might be going on cause insulin levels dropped from my last test and since my diet was pretty much same with healthy choices why is this happening. My doctor for the last seven months kept telling me to calm down and that I do not have anything cause stressing is bad for my blood glucose too. Should I be telling him to get a pancreas MRI done?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your lab results, it seems like you're showing signs of impaired glucose tolerance. Your recent blood glucose test shows that after drinking a sugar drink, your blood glucose is higher than normal but not enough to be classified as diabetes.\n\nThis could be an indicator for prediabetes - a condition where blood glucose level is higher than normal but not high enough to diagnose type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes can progress into type 2 diabetes, and weight loss through healthy eating and exercise can halt or reverse this progression.\n\nYour insulin levels are within the standard range, albeit toward the lower end. A gradual decline in insulin levels may suggest your pancreas isn't producing as much insulin, although this can also be due to several other factors including diet, stress, sleep etc. \n\nHaving said this, these lab results do not point towards a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer symptoms usually include abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice) among others, which you have not reported here. However, if you are still concerned it's always good to discuss with your doctor about your worries.\n\nPlease note that simply having low insulin does not mean one has pancreatic cancer. Also, MRI should only be ordered when there is a substantial reason or suspicion based on multiple indicators, not merely what might seem as mild changes in insulin levels. This radiological examination comes with its own set of risks and shouldn't be used as first-line diagnostics without proper indications.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I keep pushing it with my tongue and clenching a bit against it and I just noticed that it has become loose little more. I have my wisdom teeth and I think it might be applying pressure forward on these teeth. I read in a book that day grinding can cause a teeth to loosen, which is easier to treat. There is no pain and the teeth look healthy. I always clench my teeth but it never caused any looseness.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms suggest that you may have bruxism or teeth grinding, which could be causing your loose molar. Pressure from wisdom teeth can also contribute to the problem. It's good news that there's no pain and the tooth appears healthy visually.\n\nHowever, a loose tooth is not something you should ignore. The mobility could increase over time, potentially risking your oral health. Proactive steps should be taken to prevent further loosening.\n\nYou should make an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible. They might recommend a night guard to protect your teeth if you grind or clench at night. If the pressure from your wisdom teeth is contributing to the problem, you may need to have them removed.\n\nIn the meantime, avoid putting extra pressure on the tooth - try not to push it further with your tongue or chew on that side of your mouth. Follow an effective plaque control regime: brush gently twice a day and floss daily to maintain good oral hygiene. This won't treat the looseness but will help prevent further damage.\n\n## Output (b):\n What about your diet?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

She has five brown marks, two of them are 2 cm size and the other three of 0.5 cm. They are irregular in shape. Initial two marks appeared when she was 3 months old and now when she is 9 months three more for added that are comparatively light and 0.5 cm of size. Are these birthmarks? Will they fade with the time? Do we need to take any precautions so that they do not increase or get added further? Can we also provide any medication to cure them?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour baby might have what we call congenital melanocytic nevi. These are essentially birthmarks that can vary in size and color, often brown, and generally appear at birth or soon afterward. While the exact cause isn't determined, they're thought to form as a result of skin cells failing to grow normally during their development.\n\nMost of these marks are harmless and do not require treatment. They may fade or darken with age, but typically they do not completely disappear. A small number of these nevi have an elevated risk for becoming cancerous later in life, especially large ones.\n\nYou should consult your pediatrician or a dermatologist who can examine them closely. If there is any concern regarding changes in shape, size, or color, they might advise regular monitoring or even a biopsy in some cases. However, with the sizes you mentioned, it's less likely.\n\nThere is no specific medication to cure them, as they are benign skin lesions. It would be best not to avoid sun exposure and apply sunscreen on your child if she's out in the sun.\n\nRemember, this advice doesn't substitute a proper consultation. It's always better to get her examined by a professional healthcare provider.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n If you are a patient, please provide as much information about your symptoms and conditions as possible.

You may be dealing with some type of dermatitis, psoriasis or possibly an allergic reaction. The fact that Hydrocortisone Cream hasn't helped might suggest this rash isn't completely responsive to steroids, or it may simply mean that you need something stronger. It's also possible that it's infected, in which case a topical antibiotic could be needed.\n\nAlways remember to avoid scratching the area as much as possible. If itch is a problem, antihistamines such as Benadryl might help though they can cause drowsiness. \n\nHowever, given that there has been no improvement thus far, I strongly recommend that you make an appointment with a dermatologist for a physical examination as soon as possible so you can get a firm diagnosis and treatment plan.

They started a root canal but then did not finish. I have gone back several times and every time they open up the tooth and insert medicine. My tooth is in agony right now. I am just wondering if this is a standard procedure during a root canal? Should not the dentist remove the nerves so I am not in so much pain? Or is it the standard procedure to fight the infection first and then remove the nerves?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nGenerally, a root canal treatment involves creating an opening in the tooth to reach and remove the infected pulp (which is comprised of nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues), then cleaning and shaping the inside of the root canals, followed by filling and sealing the space. This procedure usually eliminates the pain you're experiencing as with the pulp removed, there are no more nerves in that tooth to transmit pain signals.\n\nHowever, sometimes if there's a severe infection or abscess at the end of the roots of your tooth, your dentist might not complete the whole process in one visit. They may instead use a temporary filling material and place medication within the tooth to help with the inflammation and infection before completely removing the pulp and finishing the root canal. \n\nBut continuous instances where the dentist re-opens the tooth and inserts medicine can also likely indicate complications or failure of the initial attempt at treating the tooth. One key point though - you should not be in \"agony\". Pain during a root canal is common but this should be manageable with over-the-counter analgesics, and should not extend for longer than a few days after each intervention.\n\nIn any case, persistent severe pain suggests something is not right. You may want to seek a second opinion from another dentist or consult with an endodontist (a specialist in root canal treatments) about your issue. Remember that all these suggestions are based on generic information and actual advice may vary depending upon various factors related to individual health conditions.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n The doctor is ready to help you.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have pain in the corner of my left eye for the past one year. I went to the doctor, and he gave me Sterdex. I used it and felt better. My pain went away. After a few months, I started to have pain, but it was not so severe as the first time. I wear glasses and lenses, and I am treating my eye allergy with Chibro Cadron 5 ml, and for dry eyes, I use Fluidabak after taking the lens. Whenever I do my yearly eye checkup, my eyesight gets worse because of the pain in the corner, and I am scared about my sight. I do not know whether I use an appropriate medicine to my eye. Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me the same medication. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt seems like you're dealing with recurrent eye pain which may be associated with prolonged use of contact lenses, dryness of the eyes, allergies or other underlying conditions. The medications you are using, Sterdex is a combination antibiotic and steroid used to treat inflammations in the eye, Chibro Cadron 5 ml is used for eye inflammation and Fluidabak is used to relieve symptoms of dry eyes.\n\nGiven your situation, I would advise a re-evaluation by an ophthalmologist. An eye exam including visual acuity test, slit lamp examination (a detailed view of the structures at the front of your eye), tonometry (check for glaucoma) and possibly a fundoscopy (examination of the back of your eye) will be required.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Limit your usage of contact lenses\n2. Maintain hygiene while handling lenses\n3. Use artificial tears on a regular basis throughout the day.\n4. Update eyeglasses prescription if needed and try using glasses more often than contacts.\n\nAgain, it's very important you seek a consultation with an ophthalmologist to review your medication and confirm there are no serious conditions associated with your recurring eye discomfort. It's critical that this gets addressed to prevent any potential long-term damage to your eyesight.\n\n## Output (b):\n It looks like your doctor is not very clear about the diagnosis.

It showed a hianal hernia 2 cm. I am attaching photos. The doctor took biopsies, said no cancer. I have had breast cancer in the past. I am having pain in the chest when I swallow, and sternum today. Will that subside? Is it from the bleeding? And, can you recommend the best pill to take for this pain, taking Pantoprazole now? And what should I take for this problem, what should I eat? (Can you assure there is no cancer)?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nUnfortunately, as an AI, I cannot view physical attachments such as photographs. But based on the information you provided, it sounds like you might be experiencing some discomfort due to the EGD procedure itself; this is quite common in many patients and should subside over time. The chest pain when swallowing could be related to irritation caused by the endoscope or the polypectomy.\n\nRegarding medication, Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) commonly used for conditions involving excess stomach acid, including hiatal hernias. This one should help with your symptoms. If the chest pain continues, I would recommend reaching out to your treating physician who might consider a short course of a mild painkiller if there are no contraindications. \n\nIn terms of diet, eating smaller meals more frequently, reducing fatty and spicy foods, and avoiding lying down immediately after eating can all be beneficial in managing hiatal hernia symptoms.\n\nAbout your cancer concern: if the doctor took biopsies during the EGD and confirmed no presence of cancer, that's very reassuring. However, keep in mind that your gastroenterologist knows your situation best. Considering your past history of breast cancer, continue following up regularly with both your primary care doctor and oncologist.\n\nRemember, online advice does not substitute an office visit, so please reach out to your personal doctor regarding these issues.\n\n## Output (b):\n How serious is this?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am 173 cm in height and weighs about 68 kg. I would like to know about testosterone injection if I took it in a small dosage weekly will that help my appearance to be more manly? Even that my appearance is manly but in general my physical built is small compared to other men, my face, hands, legs are small also my voice is feminine.My testosterone level is good. My body is too hairy and I did a testosterone test everything was normal. I know there is a lot of studies that say that testosterone can lead to depression but actually at the age of 21 I was suffering from depression and I took testosterone for a month (to gain muscles), my mood was very good and it actually helped my depression. Also, my sexual life and erection are very good, I do masturbate once or twice every two days and I get an erection easily.Kindly help me with these questions:Will testosterone injections help me be more manly? What is the recommended dose that I have to take monthly? What are testosterone injections made from, are they made from an animal source? Will testosterone affects my personality? Do I have to take it for life? What if after some period I decided to stop will I loose what I gained?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nTestosterone is the primary male sex hormone that plays key roles in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics like increased muscle and bone mass, and body hair growth. However, the use of testosterone injection should ideally be for those diagnosed with low or no testosterone because its misuse can lead to serious side effects.\n\n1. Testosterone could potentially make your appearance more \"masculine\" by increasing muscle mass and thickening your voice to some extent if it happens to be related to low testosterone levels.\n2. Only a healthcare professional can advise on appropriate dosage based on individual health conditions and needs. Because your testosterone levels are normal, it's not advisable to take extra testosterone without medical consultation.\n3. Testosterone used in injections isn't derived from animals; it's lab-synthesized to be bio-identical to human testosterone.\n4. As for personality changes, testosterone may influence mood and might cause increased aggression or competitiveness, but there's variability in individuals' responses.\n5. Unless you suffer from lifelong hypogonadism (where the body doesn't produce enough testosterone), you wouldn't necessarily need to take it for life. In fact, inappropriate usage can shut down your natural testosterone production, making you dependent on these injections for normal function.\n6. If you discontinue the injections after a while, the newly acquired features might diminish over time.\n\nGiven your presented information - normal testosterone level & overall good health, self-administering\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your answer.

Which is better at combating bad breath due to smoking than alcoholic? I am in a hygiene school and want to know whether or not to recommend non-alcohol mouthwash for the complaints of bad breath from smoking. I have recommended tongue scraping, alcoholic mouthwash. Anyways, they are not going to stop smoking or drinking. I was looking at a way to have them not dry out the tissues, but stopping the obvious factors do not seem to be an option.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBoth alcoholic and non-alcoholic mouthwashes are designed to kill bacteria in the mouth that cause bad breath, plaque, and gingivitis. However, they do vary slightly in their makeup and mode of action.\n\nAlcohol-based mouthwash has a high alcohol content which can help it to penetrate oral biofilms better and kill bacteria effectively. In addition to killing bacteria, alcohol also acts as a carrier agent for essential active ingredients like menthol, eucalyptol, and thymol which helps them permeate plaque.\n\nHowever, these alcohol-based mouthwashes can make the mouth dry by reducing saliva production over time. This can lead to more bad breath since saliva naturally counteracts bacteria and acid in the mouth. Alcohol can also irritate soft tissues in the mouth. \n\nNon-alcoholic mouthwash, on the other hand, often contains ingredients like cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) that kill bacteria without drying out the mouth. It doesn't contain alcohol, so this type could be more comfortable for those with sensitive mouths. Many tend to prefer non-alcoholic mouthwash because they find it less harsh to swish around in their mouth.\n\nGiven your concern about dehydration of oral tissues from smoking and alcohol use, recommending non-alcoholic mouthwashes may be beneficial for your patients. They should, however, still complement this with good dental hygiene practices such as regular brushing and flossing and tongue scraping. It\u2019s always best for an individual to consult with their dentist or hy\n\n## Output (b):\n Have you considered throat sprays?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My eyes still yellow. Is it unlikely hematologist who diagnosed me three years ago misdiagnosed? I do not doubt he knows his stuff. More about me getting worried. I lost weight a couple of months ago. I went very yellow in the eyes. I have always felt tired. I have had gallbladder out four years ago, I bruise easily, I do get little red skin dots at times, menstrual cycles can be irregular and spleen slightly enlarged.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nPatients diagnosed with hereditary spherocytosis typically exhibit a range of symptoms similar to yours, such as jaundice (yellowing of the eyes), fatigue, easy bruising, red blood dots (petechiae) and an enlarged spleen. These issues result from increased hemolysis or breakdown of red blood cells that are characteristic of this disease.\n\nWeight loss is not directly associated with hereditary spherocytosis; however, it may be indirectly related due to decreased appetite caused by feelings of discomfort or chronic anemia-related fatigue. The irregular menstrual cycle might also be indirectly related through hormonal imbalance induced by stress and long-term illness.\n\nThe removal of your gallbladder probably was done because individuals with hereditary spherocytosis have a higher risk of developing gallstones.\n\nIt's normal to feel worried about a chronic health condition like this. I would advise you reach out to your hematologist and discuss these concerns. It can also help to keep track of your symptoms and bring up any changes during your appointments. With proper management, most people with this disease can lead normal lives while managing their symptoms. The possible misdiagnosis is unlikely given your listed symptoms are consistent with hereditary spherocytosis. However, if necessary, genetic testing can offer conclusive evidence of this diagnosis.\n\n## Output (b):\n What about your eyes?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

My ovary is bulky with right ovary volume 11.5 cc and left ovary volume 11.2 cc. I am suffering from PCOD. I am under treatment for the past three months. Can I get pregnant naturally?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nPolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) can make it more difficult to become pregnant naturally because it may interfere with regular ovulation, which is necessary for conception. However, this does not mean it's impossible to get pregnant. Many women with PCOS have been able to conceive naturally or with the assistance of fertility treatments.\n\nThe fact that you are under treatment is positive, and often changes like eating a healthier diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity can improve your body's response to insulin and help reduce symptoms of PCOS, potentially aiding in natural fertility.\n\nAlso, medications like Clomiphene citrate or Metformin might be suggested by your doctor to stimulate ovulation if lifestyle changes aren't enough on their own. \n\nRemember to consistently keep in touch with your gynecologist about your concerns and progress. This discussion will assist them in determining the best course of action for your particular case.

I am using Clotrimazole cream over the infection. Once I miss applying cream a day, the penis gets infected with red patches, pus-filled boils and there is severe itching. My partner is not affected by any problem though we are sexually active. I am not diabetic when I saw my blood test. Kindly help me to cure it. I am frustrated with my problem. Kindly give me medical advice.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm really sorry to hear about your condition. It sounds incredibly uncomfortable and distressing. A recurring infection of the kind you're describing could possibly be a yeast infection or balanitis, especially given that it seems to respond to Clotrimazole, which is an antifungal cream.\n\nHowever, due to the recurrent and severe nature of your symptoms (red patches, pus-filled boils, severe itching), it would be advisable for you to see a healthcare professional in person - preferably a urologist or dermatologist. You may require stronger antifungal medication or antibiotics if there's also a bacterial infection, but this needs to be determined by a doctor who can examine the affected area and perhaps take a swab for testing.\n\nIn addition, even though you said your partner doesn't seem to be affected, they may still need to get checked just in case they're asymptomatic, meaning not showing any signs yet carrying the infection - because this particular infection can potentially be transmitted sexually.\n\nPlease use condoms until both of you are cleared from potential infectious causes to prevent passing the infection back and forth.\n\nDo maintain good hygiene \u2013 clean the penis thoroughly but gently with lukewarm water every day. Do not use soap directly on the area as it can worsen the irritation. Dry it well before applying any cream. \n\nRemember, keep away from self-diagnosing or self-medicating.

I experienced an episode that lasted roughly about two to three minutes where I felt that I could not seem to catch my breath and it felt as if my heart had stopped beating. I checked my heart rate roughly three minutes after the incident and it was at 60 bpm and my oxygen was at 99 % under two weeks ago. I had a routine 24 tape which was clear (ectopic beats picked up but were benign). I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. However, they generally come on during stressful situations. Could this be a panic attack symptom? I also wanted to add that this happened during intercourse (I am a 35-year-old male, height is 174 cm and weight is 100 kg). I look forward to your response and suggestions.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on the information you've provided, it's very possible that the episode you described was indeed a symptom of a panic attack. Panic attacks can manifest in many different ways and often mimic physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations or even chest pain.\n\nSexual activity can be intense and physically demanding sometimes, which might add to physiological changes like heart rate elevation, and given your description, especially in combination with an anxiety disorder, this could contribute to triggering a panic-like response. It's important not to immediately attribute all symptoms to anxiety though.\n\nIf you continue experiencing these episodes, I would recommend that you discuss them with your healthcare provider, who may want to order additional tests - such as stress test, echocardiogram etc - to rule out any potential cardiovascular conditions considering the episode happened during strenuous activity. \n\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and balanced diet could also help reduce anxiety symptoms and improve both cardiovascular and overall health. Consider seeking help from a mental health professional to help manage your panic attacks better if they are affecting your quality of life.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n Did the patient recently have illnesses or surgeries?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

A platelet count of 1314 is considered high, this condition is known as thrombocytosis. It can be a sign of several conditions which could include:\n\n1. Anemia: This condition may arise due to iron deficiency or due to loss of blood.\n\n2. Inflammations: Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or infections can cause your platelet count to rise.\n\n3. Cancer: Certain types of cancer like lung, stomach, or ovarian cancer increases the production of platelets.\n\n4. Hemolytic anemia: This type of anemia occurs when your body destroys red blood cells before their normal lifespan is over, triggering your bone marrow to produce more blood cells and inadvertently, platelets.\n\n5.

I am 54 years old and my weight is 87 kg. My medications are Metformin 500 mg, Hcl 1500 mg, Istavel 100 mg and Glaritus Insulin 30 units. Even then the sugar levels are 246, 265 and 277 after every three hours today. My creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, T3 and TSH are normal.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHello,\n\nFirstly, I understand and appreciate your concern about your elevated blood sugar levels despite ongoing treatment. As you may know, an HbA1c level of 9.83 suggests that your diabetes is not well controlled over the past three months. Your current blood glucose readings are still quite high, which means further action needs to be taken.\n\nYour medication regimen indicates a combination of oral medications (Metformin, Istavel) and injectable insulin (Glaritus). However, with persistent high blood sugar levels, several possibilities should be considered:\n\n1. Medication Dosage: You might need an adjustment in dosage of your existing medication, or possibly an addition of other classes of diabetic medication to better manage your diabetic status.\n   \n2. Diet & Exercise: Review your diet and ensure it aligns with those recommended for someone managing Type 2 Diabetes. Regular moderate-intensity exercise can also enhance insulin sensitivity and help in management of blood glucose levels.\n    \n3. Insulin Resistance: This is a condition where the body does not respond to insulin leading to build up of glucose in the blood. It might require you to switch types of insulin or take higher doses.\n   \n4. Coexisting illness: Certain medical conditions like infections, thyroid disorders etc., although these seem unlikely since your TSH is normal and there's no mention of any symptoms indicative of infection.\n\n5. Patient Compliance: Ensure you're taking medicines as prescribed. Interrupted or incorrect medication use can affect blood sugar control.\n\n\n\n## Output (b):\nWhat are the symptoms you are experiencing?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Cetirizine is an antihistamine used to relieve allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, itching eyes/nose, and sneezing. It works by blocking a certain natural substance (histamine) that your body makes during an allergic reaction.\n \nOn the other hand, Paracetamol (also known as Acetaminophen) is commonly used to alleviate pain and reduce fever. There is no known significant interaction between these two drugs.

My tongue also develops a white coating, that has to be scrapped of daily. I have attached a photo of the same. What are the likely causes?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your description and without the ability to actually visualize your tongue as pictures cannot be attached here, it sounds like you may have oral thrush (candidiasis), a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of the Candida species. It commonly presents with creamy white or yellow spots or a coating on the tongue and other parts of the mouth. A red border could indicate that the lesions are inflamed. \n\nWhile anyone can develop oral thrush, it's more likely in infants and elders, those with weakened immune systems, people who wear dentures or use inhalers for asthma, and those who have been treated with antibiotics or corticosteroids recently.\n\nHowever, there are other conditions that could cause similar symptoms so it would be best to reach out to a healthcare professional for a definite diagnosis. Other possibilities could include leukoplakia or lichen planus.\n\nPlease note that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation.

I have no fever or other symptoms. Should I be concerned? I had my atlas which was supposedly two degrees off by an atlas orthogonal chiropractor. I originally went in because of my knee and wrist pain then before I knew it, I was having my atlas adjusted by a machine. My last few days I have been miserable and feeling awful. Exhausted, my lymph nodes are so painful on the sides of my neck I have been in bed all day. I just feel this might be related but I do not know.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nWhile it's not common for atlas adjustments to directly cause painful, swollen lymph nodes, there might be an unlikely indirect connection through systemic inflammation or your body responding to perceived injury. However, this intense level of discomfort and pain is concerning and may indicate a more serious issue such as an infection or another medical condition.\n\nLymph node swelling often indicates that your body is fighting against some form of infection or illness, even if you don\u2019t have other symptoms like fever. One possibility could be that the manipulation inadvertently caused some mild tissue damage, leading to local inflammation and reactive lymph nodes.\n\nNevertheless, these are speculations and I'd recommend making an appointment with a healthcare provider ASAP so you can get evaluated and treated appropriately. This needs thorough clinical evaluation to rule out any serious causes. Also monitor yourself closely for new symptoms like fever, weight loss, night sweats, etc.\n  \nIt's also worth noting that future chiropractic interventions should always align with your comfort level and understanding, and should never result in severe discomfort afterwards, so I would engage in a discussion about this incident with your care provider at your earliest opportunity.\n\n## Output (b):\n Did the chiropractor give you any medication for the lymph nodes?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have had a lot of digestive problems for about two years. I have been diagnosed with candida and dysbiosis but my regular doctor does not seem to know what is wrong with me. I have been very stressed and have suffered anxiety since I was about 16. I was not on any medications and started taking Cymbalta a few months ago.After about three to four days, I started to notice a bit of burning in my feet. I have since stopped taking the Cymbalta about a month ago. My feet seemed fine. Then seven days ago, I have started getting really bad pain in my feet and burning and tickling and pins and needle feelings. I am not diabetic or alcoholic. I have no idea what has brought this on or whether it can be reversed. I am so stressed out. I have to be on my feet for my job for about four and a half hours every morning. Can this be tested to see if the nerve cells are either dead or just damaged and can it be reversed? This feels like it is going to ruin my life. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I will try my best to help you. It seems like you may be experiencing peripheral neuropathy, which is often characterized by pain, tingling, and other unusual sensations in the extremities such as feet.\n\nFirst off, it's good that possible causes of peripheral neuropathy such as diabetes and alcoholism have been ruled out. While these are common causes, there are many others including certain medications (indeed, Cymbalta could potentially cause these symptoms), some infections, autoimmune diseases and trauma or pressure on the nerve.\n\nThe burning sensation might be related to your recently stopping Cymbalta, as abrupt cessation can lead to withdrawal effects, one of which includes abnormal sensations like \"pins and needles\". However, these usually resolve over time without treatment.\n\nYour stress and anxiety might also be contributing factors to your condition. Your body's reaction to stress can manifest physically, including exacerbating pain and discomfort.\n\nIn order to clarify things further, it would be beneficial to get a comprehensive health checkup. You should see a neurologist or pain specialist who can perform tests such as an electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction study; these can provide information about the damage to nerves.\n\nTreatment of peripheral neuropathy focuses on treating the underlying cause and providing symptomatic relief. If indeed caused by withdrawing from Cymbalta, symptoms should decrease over time.

The symptoms you're describing could be suggestive of petechiae, which are small, round pin-point spots appearing under the skin that aren't typically raised or itchy. Petechiae happen due to bleeding under the skin and they can occur as a result of certain medical conditions, taking certain medications, injury/trauma, straining (like intense coughing or vomiting), or for reasons unknown.\n\nHowever, diagnosis requires face-to-face consultation with a trained physician. It is very important to see your healthcare provider as soon as possible to examine these spots because they may indicate a serious condition such as low platelet count, blood clotting issues, infections, etc.\n\nPlease remember this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation.

After that, I got some tests done, which resulted in CMV IgG positive. Then I got vaccinated for rubella to prevent any casualties in the next pregnancy. Now I want to try and conceive, but just now I got my torch panel done again. And now the HSV IGM is positive with 1.15 range along with CMV and rubella IgG positive. Should I wait or can I try to conceive right now? My husband\\s torch panel also done, nothing abnormal.I am currently under Folic acid and Multivitamin, for now, to conceive faster. And also a homeopathic medicine for migraine.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nA positive CMV and rubella IgG indicates past infection and confers immunity, which is why vaccination for rubella is provided. The HSV IgM being positive suggests a recent or current herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, it's important to understand that this could be either oral or genital herpes.\n\nBefore you try to conceive, I recommend discussing this with your OB/GYN or an infectious disease specialist as there can potentially be transmission of HSV to the baby during delivery if there are active lesions. Treatment before getting pregnant might reduce the risk.\n\nYour doctor may also consider antiviral treatment or other precautionary measures during your pregnancy to prevent neonatal herpes. But every situation is different because whether herpes poses a threat depends on various factors such as timing of transmission and status of maternal antibodies.\n\nPlease remember that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may vary.

He is 14 months and 1 week old. He has not started to walk by his own but started to crawl since 12 months. Is there a problem with his leg muscle?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, it is important to reassure you that every child develops different skills at their own pace. At 14 months, it's not unusual for some children to have not started walking yet. Generally, most children start walking independently between 9 to 17 months. If your son has already started crawling, that\u2019s a good sign as it indicates he is gaining the strength and balance necessary to eventually move on to walking. \n\nHowever, if you notice any other symptoms such as lack of coordination, weakness, inability to bear weight  on his legs, or general motor skill delays, then it would be worth consulting with a pediatrician. It might also be recommended to check regular milestones like sitting without support, standing with assistance etc. If there are issues in those areas too, you should consult a pediatrician who may recommend a physical therapist.\n\nRemember, each child grows and develops at their own rate, so avoid comparing him to others.\n\n## Output (b):\n Okay, I'm going to need you to answer this question for the doctor.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I do not have any problem with swallowing. Kindly advise me the needful.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nHello, it's great news that after taking antibiotics your tonsillitis pain has subsided. However, the feeling of something stuck in your throat might be a residual symptom from the infection, or could be due to another reason such as pharyngitis or even post nasal drip.\n\nFor now, you can try some home remedies like warm salt water gargles and hydration which is particularly good for keeping the mucus moist and thin thereby reducing the sensation of something being 'stuck'.\n\nHowever, if your symptoms persist beyond a week, or if you develop any other symptoms like weight loss, difficulty swallowing, voice changes or prolonged cough, do consult your doctor again since these could indicate conditions with greater severity that demand immediate attention. Do not ignore these signs if they appear. \nThis advice is given based on your described symptoms , but without proper physical examination and relevant investigations, accurate diagnosis cannot be made.\n\n## Output (b):\n Does the pain in your throat worsen when you swallow?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

These small red pimples create a red area when seen from far away because they are very small and inflamed. It never disappears. My skin always feels stuck and not flexible and with a mildly itchy or burning sensation. No matter how much moisturizer I apply, it does not help. I am using Eucerin atopic control moisturizer and a gel cleanser with Hyaluronan. I even tried using Metronidazole and tea oil, but again it did not help. I have also tried to stop using anything on my face for some days, but it stayed the same. I am 24 years old now, and I never had acne tendencies when I was a teenager, and my skin always looked very smooth. My birth control pill is still the same as it was when I first started taking it, which wad around ten years ago. I do not use steroid creams nor fluoride toothpaste. How can I get rid of this? It was not there before a year. I am attaching a picture of my face. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry, but as a artificial intelligence, I can't physically examine you nor view any photos. However, based on your description, it seems like you might be dealing with a skin condition known as rosacea, perioral dermatitis or another similar type of chronic, inflammatory skin problem. These conditions are often associated with the symptoms you mentioned: small pimples that don't clear up, redness, and sensations of itching or burning.\n\nHowever, only a qualified professional healthcare provider can provide an accurate diagnosis. So, book an appointment with your dermatologist to confirm if this is what's causing the problems in your case. There they will enable customized treatment plans which may include oral antibiotics, topical creams, laser treatments, lifestyle changes, etc. \n\nRemember, not all skin disorders respond to over-the-counter products, regardless of how effective those products may be for other people or other types of skin issues. It's best not to self-medicate too much without knowing exactly what the problem is because you might inadvertently worsen the issue. The doctor might need to prescribe you something different than Metronidazole or tea tree oil.\n\nIn the meantime, try gentle cleansing, avoid picking or scratching at the area, and keep out of harsh weather as much as possible. Cold, wind, heat, and sun exposure can sometimes exacerbate these kinds of conditions. Maintaining a comforting and clean environment for your skin could help ease the situation till you visit your dermatologist.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Here is my question: There are five pills left in the blister, and because of your advice I would like to quit right now from taking pills. Is it alright to stop now or should I finish the pills this month and then stop taking them?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIf you already have an intrauterine device (IUD), like Mirena, then typically there's no need to take additional contraceptive pills. The IUD itself is effective in preventing pregnancy.\n\nRegarding your current situation where you have 5 pills remaining and wish to stop taking them due to the presence of the IUD, it should be safe for you to discontinue the pills now. This decision should not decrease the effectiveness of your birth control since you're relying on the Mirena.\n\nHowever, please understand that changes in hormones (due to starting or stopping birth control pills) can potentially lead to some side effects such as mood swings, changes in menstrual bleeding, or temporary changes in skin conditions. \n\nAdditionally, if your baseline body temperature is consistently high and not related to environmental factors, it would be worth checking with your healthcare provider to rule out any underlying causes such as infections, hormonal imbalances or other health issues. Changes in menstrual bleeding could also be due to adjusting to the IUD, but persistently heavy or long-lasting periods should also be evaluated by your healthcare provider.\n\n## Output (b):\n If the patient is not a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I originally felt the pain after playing lots of baseballs (swinging a baseball bat many times). I have symptoms such as tightness, limited mobility or restricted range of motion, throbbing pain, and sometimes it gets so bad that it became hard for me to even walk or sit! I went to my athletic trainer a month ago, and she told me she thinks it is just an aggravated muscle spasm. So she told me to just give it some rest from the activity that hurt it. So I gave it about a month, in which it seemed there was no pain. But as soon as I tried to do the activity that hurt me in the first place, it went right back to hurting. It would be of great help for any assistance. What should I do now?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nFrom your description, it does sound like a muscle strain or spasm related to overuse from playing baseball. The fact that symptoms improved with rest but worsened when you returned to the activity suggests it's directly related to your sporting activities.\n\nHowever, given the severity and duration of your pain, I would advise seeing a healthcare professional for a full evaluation. They may recommend things like physical therapy, muscle relaxants, or exercises and stretches to help strengthen your lower back muscles and improve flexibility.\n\nFurthermore, they can rule out more serious conditions such as a herniated disc, which may present with similar symptoms. It is also advisable to seek instruction on proper form and warm-up exercises before returning to your sport in order to prevent this condition from recurring.\n\nUntil you are able to see a healthcare provider, try to rest, use heat or cold packs, take over-the-counter pain relievers, and avoid any activities that worsen the pain. Gentle stretching and walking can often be beneficial as well.\n\n## Output (b):\n Please help!

She had negative home pregnancy tests, a negative test at the doctor, and had a miscarriage the next day after doctors test. My question is, could it be possible there is another fetus remaining inside? I only ask because we each have one parent that is a twin. Please advise.She thought she was on her period the entire week. Bled for seven days. Sheattributed it to the Plan-b pill she took several weeks back. We hadunprotected sex but I still pulled out. She is on birth control andused a Plan-b pill. How is any of this miscarriage stuffpossible especially after just seeing the doctor the day beforemiscarriage?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nSince both home and doctor's tests revealed a negative outcome, it suggests that the hormone levels which indicate pregnancy (human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG) were not high enough to be detected. It is feasible that your partner miscarried very early in the pregnancy when the hormonal changes are usually not substantial yet\u2014this is known as a chemical pregnancy.\n\nThe bleeding could actually have been the miscarriage itself rather than her period, especially if it was more painful or heavier than usual. Or, the miscarriage may have happened after the bleeding due to other factors.\n\nUsing emergency contraception like Plan-B and regular birth control might not always prevent every single instance of conception. Emergency contraception is most effective within 72 hours after unprotected sex and even then, is not 100% preventive. Similarly, no birth control method is completely foolproof. \n\nAs for another fetus remaining inside, it's quite unlikely given that a negative pregnancy test before the miscarriage would indicate absence of any detectable level of pregnancy hormones. Having one parent each who is a twin does raise the chances of having twins but doesn't guarantee it. Since this wasn't a confirmed pregnancy, it's hard to definitively say whether twins might have been possible.\n\nRegardless, I suggest your partner should see her doctor for follow-up care after her miscarriage to ensure she's recovering well physically and emotionally. Her doctor can undertake further investigations if he/she deems necessary based on her medical history.\n\n\n## Output (b):\n How old is your partner?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have had a couple of speech therapy sessions but progress is glacial. I am still hoarse and in pain. I have been on 40 mg of Omeprazole for a month and Gaviscon Double Action for two weeks. I feel like the back of my throat is still swollen and I have pain in the corners of my throat. This only briefly eases when I really do some throat opening exercises. I cannot talk for very long without everything getting sore still. I have been like this since the beginning of the year since I had a chest infection and pneumonia. My mouth is now getting sore from all the Gaviscon tablets as the liquid irritates the corners of my throat. I really do not know what else I can do. I am having panic attacks and starting to feel like the only option is to take my life. I had a post nasal drip for most of the year so far and I am trying to get my salivary glands to work again properly.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need.

It just got worse. I play soccer and that and the sweat is what was irritating it. So I finally went to the doctor and they prescribed me SMZ, TMP DS. I took it for about a week until I realized I was having a lot of side effects and an allergic reaction especially around my mouth. At first I thought I was just breaking out. Then it was not like sores or blisters. I kept self-treating the rash around my mouth and stopped taking the antibiotics. For a couple days it was gone. I was happy. Then I was in the sun one day for soccer and it was just like another rash but worse. I stayed home from school, did not do anything because I just wanted to get it better. But now it looks really bad. I believe I have perioral dermatitis. It is red patches all around my mouth. It is really dry and scaly, also there are like white-heads around my mouth also but they are not whiteheads. I would try to moisturize it with coconut oil or tea tree oil but I think that is what made it worse.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt sounds like you're going through a tough time with your skin. You haven't specified the cause or source of your initial secondary burn, which could be important as it may still be affecting your healing process. Sulfa-medications (like SMZ/TMP DS) can unfortunately cause hypersensitivity reactions in some people, including rash and photosensitivity (i.e., sensitivity to sunlight).\n\nThe presentation you describe around your mouth could indeed be perioral dermatitis, characterized by red, scaly patches and tiny bumps or \"pustules\" aka whiteheads. However, keep in mind other possibilities too such as an allergic contact dermatitis - maybe from ingredients in lip products or toothpaste.\n\nMoisturizing is important but choose products wisely \u2013 many natural oils, like coconut oil or tea tree oil, can actually irritate or worsen certain conditions. In general, opt for hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic (won't clog pores), fragrance-free options when possible. \n\nSince over-the-counter self-treatment hasn't been successful, it might be best to revisit a healthcare provider. A dermatologist would be ideal, if obtainable. Your condition warrants an examination and possibly testing for a more precise diagnosis, followed by guided treatment. This could include topical creams or gels, oral medications, or others depending on the specific diagnosis.\n\n## Output (b):\n Does the patient have any of the following symptoms?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Could you also tell me by perhaps drawing on the shot what waves and shapes indicate problems?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to view attachments, images or provide hands-on assistance. However, I can help explain what doctors generally look for on a treadmill stress test and some conditions it may reveal.\n\nOn a treadmill stress test (also known as exercise ECG or Exercise Stress Test), physicians monitor:\n\n1. Heart rate response: Normally, heart rate increases with progressive exercise.\n2. Blood pressure response: Healthy blood pressure tends to rise during exertion but should not exceed certain values.\n3. Presence of chest pain or other suggestive symptoms.\n4. Physical performance: How someone manages the demands of increasing physical stress is also part of such a test.\n5. Electrocardiogram changes: Ischemia caused by coronary artery disease can result in specific changes in the electrocardiograph, including ST segment depression/elevation or T wave inversion.\n  \nIf your report mentions an infarction, it might be due to the presence of significant Q waves which are indicators of previous myocardial infarctions (\"heart attacks\"). The location of these waves can suggest the area of the heart affected and the possible artery involved. The severity and timing of an infarction cannot typically be determined precisely from a stress test alone; however, the presence of significant Q waves often indicates serious past damage.\n\nA machine error is unlikely if proper procedures were followed, though results should always be interpreted alongside clinical symptoms and further corroborated by diagnostic tools like imaging studies\n\n## Output (b):\n The report indicates that there is an infarction on the left ventricle and that a stress test was performed.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

High levels of TSH could possibly indicate that you have a condition called hypothyroidism, where your thyroid gland does not produce adequate amounts of thyroid hormones.

It has been there a good few months now and the area is swollen. Is this cancer?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I can't make a definitive diagnosis online without examining you personally. However, your symptoms could be attributed to several conditions. While rare cases of tonsil cancer do exist, it is more common that these kind of issues are due to tonsillitis or tonsil stones, which can cause similar symptoms - lumps, swelling and discomfort in the throat area.\n\nTonsil stones are small deposits of food particles, mucus, and bacteria that get trapped in the tonsils' pocket and harden over time. They're usually harmless but can produce unpleasant symptoms.\n\nHowever, If the lump doesn\u2019t go away, it increases in size, or you have other symptoms like unexplained weight loss, difficulty swallowing, bleeding or persistent pain, you should consult with healthcare provider promptly for better evaluation. A physical examination or further tests may be needed to confirm what these symptoms are related to.

All her life she thought she had a problem with her heart but she went to see a doctor and he said she is in perfect health. She starts shaking and cannot breathe and I am really scared and try to calm her down but she cannot breathe. She cannot stop shaking for at least half an hour. I do not know what to do and I hope you can tell me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear about the severity of your friend's panic attacks and anxiety. These conditions can indeed resemble certain heart problems, which is why people often get confused and scared.\n\nReassure your friend that although panic attacks are remarkably intense and frightening, they're not harmful by themselves. Seek professional help for her - a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders.\n\nIn the mean time, there are several things you can do if she's experiencing a panic attack:\n\n1) Help your friend to conduct \"four square\" breathing: Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold the breath for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, and remain empty for 4 seconds before repeating again. This practice helps to calm the body and reduce physical symptoms of a panic attack.\n\n2) Encourage her to stay grounded in the present moment by asking her to describe what she sees, hears, and feels around her.\n\n3) Encourage progressive muscle relaxation: Help her relax all of the muscles in her body, one at a time. Start from toes moving up through the legs, trunk, arms and finally the face.\n\nBut most importantly, professional help should be sought. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been shown to be very effective in treating panic disorders and anxiety. Medications like benzodiazepines or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might also be considered as per physician's advice.\n\nEncourage her to avoid caffeine, alcohol, smoking and recreational drugs,\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the patient's age?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

Recently, I have elevated AST levels. There is no hepatitis or inflammatory diseases, alcohol, drug use, or fatty liver, or Addison\\s.Liver biopsy showed inflammation, but a resolving process likely attributed to a year long Lyme disease treatment with various pharmaceuticals but discontinued two years ago. Liver enzymes dropped to 50 ALT, but have recently elevated to 130 ALT.At this point, there is no known cause. I was told to continue to wait and see. I would like to take a different approach and determine if there is something my hepatologist is not seeing. The current medications are Lamictal and Gabapentin, Trazodone. I had abdominal CT, abdominal MRI, liver biopsy, ultrasounds, and a significant amount of blood work.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe elevation of both the ALT and AST levels indicate some form of liver injury or inflammation. It's good that you've had so many tests done to rule out most of the common causes like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, alcohol use, etc. However, it can sometimes be difficult to identify a clear cause in cases like this.\n\nOne possibility could be your medications - Gabapentin, Trazodone, and especially Lamictal, which are known to potentially affect the liver in rare instances. \n\nOverexertion and intense physical exercise is another recent finding that might cause elevation in these enzymes.\n\nAutoimmune hepatitis is another possible diagnosis that should be considered. It is an immune system condition where the body attacks its own liver cells causing inflammation and at the same time increases enzymes like ALT, AST. \n\nI suggest discussing these possibilities with your hepatologist. You may need additional testing such as a repeat liver biopsy, autoimmune or genetic markers studies (like for Wilson's disease or hemochromatosis) if not already done.\n\nIt would also be beneficial to talk about possibly switching one or more of your current drugs under careful supervision to see if this improves your liver enzyme levels.

I consulted a doctor a long time ago. The doctor told me that it is normal. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nWhile I'm an AI, my programming is based on medical knowledge so I can provide advice regarding this issue. Small pimple-like bumps on the penis or testicles can be caused by many things including: \n\n1. Pearly penile papules: Small domed-shaped or thread-like skin-colored pimples that are very common and completely harmless. They typically show up on the ridge of the glans (the 'head' of the penis).\n   \n2. Fordyce spots: These are tiny white or yellowish spots, found on the head or the shaft of the penis or in the scrotum. They're sebaceous glands (glands that produce sebum) that have no hair follicle and because of that, they appear as small spots. They are also completely normal and harmless.\n   \n3.

All were negative. The antibody test I took is not a fourth generation test. Is it conclusive or should I take another test? If I repeat the HIV test after six months what is the chance of staying negative? I am facing the problem like small bumps in the tongue, from the last two days a little bit of pain below ear region and it is a little swollen. Is it due to HIV? I am stressed, scared, full of tension. These are hampering my life. I do not know what to do. Today I am in the 107th day of exposure.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on the HIV tests you've had done so far, it seems as though you are HIV negative. Typically, a test taken 3 months after exposure is considered conclusive. The ELISA antibody tests and the HIV proviral DNA PCR tests that you've had done are reliable at detecting the virus in your body.\n \nHIV may cause a variety of symptoms, however, most commonly these can include fever, sore throat, fatigue - signs that are often confused with a flu-like illness. What you're describing with bumps on your tongue and swelling/pain near your ear may be unrelated to an HIV infection, perhaps some other infection or inflammation. Of course, without further examination, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer.\n\nAs for repeating the HIV test 6 months post-exposure, under rare circumstances where the immune system takes longer to produce detectable antibodies, testing negative after six months would likely rule out HIV infection entirely. However, this level of delay in seroconversion is not common. \n\nRegardless, I recommend trying to stay calm and seeking medical attention for your current symptoms. Persistent anxiety over potential HIV infection despite multiple negative tests might mean that speaking with a mental health provider could be beneficial for you too. It's important to remember that although the virus can be life-changing, HIV is now considered a chronic but manageable disease, thanks largely to advances in antiretroviral therapy. Regular use of condoms provides excellent protection against transmission.\n\n## Output (b):\n Thank you for your question.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have never really taken them off. I would sleep with the contact lenses in my eyes and I have started wearing them since I was 13 years old. I would change them, but I would not take them off, and I would go days. My vision gets worse when I go to the eye doctor, but I have not had problems with infections. Recently I noticed that my left eye is red without pain or irritation, but red as the color of the pink eye. I do not know if it is the contact lenses which is causing the redness. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nSleeping with contact lenses on can lead to a number of problems, including but not limited to an increase in infections, corneal neovascularization (new blood vessels growing into the clear part of the eye), and changes in your cornea that may permanently affect your vision. That being said, it's impossible for me to diagnose exactly why your eye is red without an examination. The lack of pain or irritation is a good sign, but persistent redness can indicate a problem like inflammation or an infection, even if you've never had an infection before.\n\nYou absolutely must remove your contacts and stop wearing them immediately until you see your doctor. If the redness subsolves after removing the lens, then it was most likely due to the contact lens - perhaps hypoxia (lack of oxygen) to your cornea, since constant contact use does not allow enough oxygen to reach the cornea. But if redness continues or gets worse, this could be an emergency situation such as a corneal ulcer. Please seek immediate medical attention from an ophthalmologist promptly when symptoms persist.\n  \nPlease remember to follow proper contact lens hygiene moving forward: do not sleep in your lenses unless they are specifically designed for extended wear, always cleanse them properly, replace as recommended by your eye care provider, and take breaks from wearing them when possible.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I was doing it too fast, and at one point, I got a sharp pain in my back, near where my ribs meet my spine. Since then, I am also having very sharp pain when inhaling and exhaling, as well as when rotating my torso or neck. Should I need to go for urgent care? Currently, I am taking Zyrtec, Amino acid supplements for energy and muscle recovery, hormonal IUD.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nWhat you're describing may be an injured muscle or rib, possibly a strain or even a tear. Exhaling and inhaling causes movement in the torso which can further irritate a strained muscle. It's important that you get this pain checked out to rule out anything more serious since your symptoms involve respiratory discomfort.\n\nThe medications and supplements you mentioned do not interfere with this situation specifically but it might help your healthcare provider make decisions on what medications they can provide you for possible therapy. \n\nYes, I'd recommend seeking urgent medical attention especially because of sharp chest pain and difficulty breathing. Even though it seems like this occurred due to excessive workout, it is highly crucial to rule out any other critical health issues such as pleurisy (inflammation of tissues that line the lungs and chest cavity), lung conditions, heart problems and others.\n\nPlease remember, although it's vital to exercise, its pertinent we follow our body's cues to prevent injuries. Always remember warm ups and cool downs are essential before intense sessions and increasing intensity gradually helps our body adapt better preventing any sudden shocks.

I have seen my period in the second month of last year and miss it up for a further two months. I have seen it again after three months and stopped at the end of that month. But anytime I have sexual intercourse, I will bleed and past lots of blood clots for at least three days and then stop, and I waited for four days.

It sounds like your menstrual cycle is irregular and there's abnormal bleeding after intercourse, both of which could have several potential underlying causes, including hormonal imbalances (like PCOS), infections, fibroids, endometriosis or more serious conditions such as cervical or uterine cancer.\n\nIt's essential to seek immediate medical attention. You should discuss your history and symptoms with a healthcare professional who can guide you on the next steps.

The last week I have had constant headaches and periodic blurry vision. I am wondering if this could be a result of not wearing my glasses. How often should I be wearing my glasses? The periodic blurry vision started two weeks ago and one week ago the constant headache started (4 to 6 out of 10). I have seen a few different doctors about it but they are not sure.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour prescription indicates that you have astigmatism and myopia (short-sightedness), which means your eye can't focus light properly onto the retina. When you don\u2019t wear your glasses, your eyes will strain to try to get a clear image. This additional effort your eyes make can cause headaches as well as blurry vision.\n\nSo, yes, your symptoms could indeed be due to not wearing your glasses. Generally, if glasses are prescribed for full-time use, they should be worn throughout the day, especially during tasks that require clear distance vision like driving or watching television.\n\nHowever, it is also important to consider other possible causes of your symptoms such as migraines, stress, high blood pressure, eye strain from excessive screen time, or some underlying systemic conditions. I would recommend returning to the ophthalmologist for a comprehensive recheck. If everything turns out fine on the eye exam then perhaps explore other possibilities with your primary care doctor. \n\nIn the meantime, please start using your eyeglasses consistently.\n\n## Output (b):\n Is it true that you experience headaches, constant?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

This can cause damage to the surrounding tissues as well and explain the bleeding. \n\nI suggest you immediately go to the emergency department since this could potentially be serious. Dental injuries often require immediate attention and if left untreated can lead to severe complications such as an infection or permanent damage.\n\nPainkillers can aid in managing the pain but avoid taking Aspirin right now as it might increase the bleeding. Try not to touch or agitate the area more than necessary. Consider rinsing your mouth with a warm salt water solution (half a teaspoon of salt dissolved in 8 ounces of warm water) \u2013 this will help keep your mouth clean. Until you get professional care, try to keep the tooth in its original place by applying gentle pressure. \n\nFinding immediate professional treatment is crucially important when experiencing any sort of dental trauma so I would strongly recommend seeing a dentist or visiting Emergency Department ASAP.\n\n## Output (b):\n What is the patient's name?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

So, I want to know what is happeing with me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThese symptoms could possibly point to a few conditions, such as peptic ulcers or gastritis. These conditions can cause pain in your upper abdomen that's usually felt more on an empty stomach. The warm and itchy feeling around the belly button isn't typical for this type of conditions but can be part of your personal symptomatology.

I have no cut on lips and mouth. Is there any chance of me getting any STI?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) from kissing is generally low. Most STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, are primarily transmitted through sexual activity, not kissing. However, certain infections, such as herpes or oral HPV can be spread through skin-to-skin contact, which includes kissing.\n\nAs for the breasts, most STIs aren't passed on this way unless there were visible sores on her skin that came into direct contact with your mouth and you had open sores or cuts on your lips or in your mouth, the chance of transmission is quite low.\n \nNevertheless, it's important to remember that some infections may not show symptoms right away, or at all. Regular testing is key to detecting and treating them early. If you feel anxious about the incident, get tested to put your mind at ease. \n\nIn future, always practice safe interactions to further decrease risk.\n\n## Output (b):\n Are you a doctor?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I am 5\\7\" in height and140 lbs weight. My dad is 5\\9, and my mom is 5\\1. I would like to at least reach 5\\9 to 5\\10. My diet is exceptional. I am taking a multivitamin, and I do not have any deficiencies. I am thinking of taking 1500 mg of Glucosamine because I read studies concluding that it may help a bit. Would you recommend glucosamine, or something else?Also, do you think I can still reach my height goal? I am worried that I may have stunted my growth. I have had insomnia, depression, and anxiety for four years now. This has affected my life considerably, and I am worried I would not grow to my potential height because of it. I also have not been getting too much calcium and protein because I have been avoiding dairy products. Should I be drinking more milk and if so, how much?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, it's important to note that individual growth and height are influenced by several factors - the most significant being your genetics. With parents of 5'1\" and 5'9\", as an average you can anticipate reaching somewhere around the mid-range given your current height at age 17. \n\nWhile certain studies point towards potential benefits of glucosamine for cartilage health, it is not directly correlated with increasing growth in humans and I would advise against using it purely for that purpose.\n\nConsidering your insomnia, anxiety, and depression, these conditions could potentially impact your physical health, including stunting growth if they caused significant malnutrition or distress during critical growth periods.

If you tolerate them well, dairy can be a good source of protein and calcium, but there are also many plants-based sources rich in those nutrients like almonds, beans and lentils, tofu, some leafy green vegetables, chia seeds etc. Additionally, fish and eggs are excellent non-dairy protein and calcium sources.\n\nIt is quite unlikely that you will gain much more height since most males finish growing by about age 16-18, however, some may continue into their early twenties.

My back gets locked when I am standing still. There is too much pain on the right side while sitting on a hard surface. There is also nerve pain after having food sitting on the ground. There is pain only on the right side while using the commode. I am suffering from this pain from the past two years and have not got any relief. Kindly help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nYour symptoms of back pain, particularly on one side, that worsens with certain movements or positions and seems to involve some nerve involvement is suggestive of conditions like sciatica, muscle strain, herniated disc, or possibly a more serious condition like spinal stenosis. However, diagnosing any medical condition requires a detailed clinical examination and often further diagnostic tests.\n\nYou'll need an evaluation from a physician who may consider X-rays, MRI, CT scan or other imaging studies for proper diagnosis. Consultation with a physical therapist might also provide additional insight and possible treatment options for managing your pain.\n\nIt's crucial to mention that persistent pain deserves professional medical attention - so if you haven't done so already, please see a healthcare provider in person as soon as possible.\n\n\nThese recs are for information purposes only.

I see a flash of light when I look right to left in the left side of my eye. It is a curve from top to bottom. It happens in daylight, nighttime, and even in the dark with my eyes closed. I move my pupil left to right and see a bright arc of light. I cannot make it stay there, it just flashes as I move my eye balls left to right. Any ideas?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nThe symptoms you're describing could be related to a condition called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) where the back part of the vitreous, a jelly-like substance in your eye, pulls away from the retina. This often happens naturally as we age.\n\nHowever, it could also be an indication of more serious conditions like a retinal tear or detachment which requires immediate medical attention. These are rather rare but should not be neglected if they occur.\n\nPlease get your eyes examined immediately by an ophthalmologist and describe the symptoms carefully to them. They might perform some tests including an examination of the back of your eye after dilating your pupils.

SGOT (AST): Normal - though the upper limit for many labs is around 40, slight variations can occur based on things like muscle activity.\n4. SGPT (ALT): Slightly Elevated - this could mean some form of liver disease or injury, but would have to be evaluated in context with your symptoms and other tests.\n5. Vitamin D: On the lower side of normal - Depending on the lab's reference values, you might be considered to have vitamin D insufficiency.\n\nMake sure to discuss these results further with your doctor, especially regarding the slightly elevated ALT and Vitamin D level.

I am 173 cm. My mother is 173 cm and father is 189 cm. I had a blood test to determine my HGH levels. The doctor asked me for a testosterone and GH test. The result came back a week later and it said that I had a low HGH level and a 21/42 level testosterone. Is this normal for an 18 year old male? I was devastated that my growth plates were closed, because I also had an x-ray of left hand. My doctor asked me whether I am sexually active. I answered him no. But, I got a doubt regarding erectile dysfunction. Am I suffering from erectile dysfunction? Should I be worried? Is my testosterone too low? How can I increase testosterone? I had torsion three years back and nothing back happened. But, this could be a factor. Another factor may be that I used to hold my mobile phone in my pocket all the time.I am a sprint athlete and have defined leg muscles, but this could be due to my short stature. I have gone for another blood test for GH, just as a follow up and that time I was advised to fast for 14 hours. But, I did not fast during my first blood test. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nBased on your information, you seem to have multiple concerns related to growth, testosterone levels, possible erectile dysfunction, and the influence of a past torsional injury.\n\nYour height is influenced not just by your parents' heights but also other factors including nutrition and health during childhood. Your height appears within normal limits and it may not increase further as the bones in your hand have already closed, suggesting overall skeletal maturity.\n\nTestosterone levels could vary with time of day, so interpretation depends on when it was measured and what kind of test was used. The 21/42 level you mentioned isn't well-defined (since units are missing), so it's difficult to know its exact implications. However, generally speaking, low Testosterone can lead to less body hair, more body fat, smaller muscles, lower sex drive and problems getting erections.\n\nErectile dysfunction means difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection that's sufficient for sexual activity. If you're experiencing such issues, then yes, you might be dealing with ED. But if you did not mention this issue to your doctor, he perhaps asked about your sexual activity to understand if you have any secondary sexual characteristics, which are an indirect measure of sex hormones like testosterone.\n\nTo improve testosterone levels, maintain a healthy lifestyle - balanced diet, regular exercise, enough sleep, and minimal stress. Also, overweight and some medication may affect testosterone levels\u2014it needs further investigation in case you do fall under these categories.\n\nTorsion shouldn\u2019t have long-term impacts unless it led to\n\n## Output (b):\n What is your age?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I feel that I am recovering normally from what I was told and what I read. However, the area immediately above my belly button is extremely sore and appears to almost be bulging and is slightly elevated when touched. I did have my follow up and questioned this area and he cited the muscle repair and the liposuction but I wanted to get a second opinion on this and see if anyone has had similar experiences that are normal.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a doctor, I would suggest that discomfort and swelling near the area of surgery is indeed very common after abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) combined with liposuction. Both the muscle repair and liposuction could cause these effects in the post-operative period. \n\nHowever, the phrase 'bulging' and mention of it being 'slightly elevated' when touched may potentially indicate serum or hematoma formation (collection of fluid/blood), especially if it feels like a fluid-filled balloon under your skin. This might happen after any type of body contouring or plastic surgery procedures to some extent and can be managed appropriately by your surgeon.\n\nWhile this could still be within the range of normalcy for the recovery process, you should definitely keep an open line of communication with your primary surgeon who knows your situation best. Consider getting a follow-up appointment sooner rather than later, since physical examinations are crucial in such situations and much more informative than online consultations. If it becomes significantly painful, or you develop fever, redness around the area, nausea or vomiting, then seek immediate medical care as these could potentially be signs of infection or other complications.

I usually ace my tests because I have a very short term memory, so cramming often makes do. But, I often tend to forget things when my body takes the so-called auto-pilot mode. During these times, I tend to do things with me, not really focusing on doing it because I was thinking of something else. I cannot really recall what exactly happened in a day when nothing special has occurred. I often forget where I put things, even when they are already in front of me, or in my hand. I seem to misplace habitually and it has pertrubed my parents. Now I am wandering if these are early symptoms of Alzheimer\\s. Please reply, and if you want to ask questions about me,feel free.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nIt's understandable that you're concerned, but it's essential to remember that although Alzheimer's disease can start early in rare cases, it typically occurs in people over the age of 65. More likely, based on your age and symptoms, is some form of attention deficit or even a mild cognitive impairment. Sometimes these experiences might be tied with stress or overwhelming situations.\n\nThe symptoms you are describing (forgetfulness, 'auto-pilot mode,' misplacing items) could be indicators of a variety of things. They may be a sign of ADHD, particularly since they have been present since childhood. Another feasible explanation would be symptoms related to anxiety or depression which often manifests as concentration problems leading to forgetfulness. \n\nNevertheless, in order to accurately diagnose your condition, it's crucial for you to schedule an appointment with a professional healthcare provider. Initially, I will recommend a consult with a primary care physician who can do initial assessment and then refer to a specialist if required. This generally involves a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and possibly imaging studies to rule out any other issues that could be causing your symptoms. Differentiating between all these conditions needs a thorough evaluation, so please don't hesitate to seek help!\n\n## Output (b):\n Excuse me, doctor, there are some questions that we need to ask about the patient's health history.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I think she also has rheumatoid arthritis. For the past five years, she was managing the pain with anti-inflammatory medicine, Lyrica, Mythycobal, Voltaren injections, herbal creams, etc. You can see the veins in her hands popping out. I also realized that the pain has got worse now.For about 12 months the doctor put her only on Prednisolone 5 mg/day and painkiller when necessary. She was fine till last month but the pain increased in her hands now. In the daytime she is fine and the pain starts mildly in the evening. When she lies down in the bed she gets electrical tingling in her legs by which her sleep gets disturbed. She has undergone several tests last week and I attached them for your reference. She did not consult a rheumatologist yet. What medication can I give to reduce the inflammation and cure her? Her ESR, CPR, and ANA are quite high. The pain in her hands and the tingling in her legs at night are agonizing her life. Kindly provide your expert advice.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\nAs a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have access to blood tests or imaging results but based on the symptoms you described for your mother, it does sound like her rheumatological condition is escalating. I suggest the following steps:\n\n1. Referral to a Rheumatologist: This specialist will be able to make a definitive diagnosis of whether your mother has Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in addition to fibromyalgia and can guide medication management accordingly. They might need further testing such as RF( Rheumatoid factor) and Anti-CCP test and assess joints status by physical examination.\n\n2. Medications: It's important that she continues with prescribed medications until she meets a specialist. Short term increase of Prednisolone might be advised if Pain felt uncontrolled but consulting with doctor is necessary before modifying any dosages.\n  \n3. Physiotherapy: A good physiotherapy program could help maintain joint mobility and function.\n\n4. Healthy Lifestyle: Ensure a balanced diet and mild activity daily, this will aid overall health which indirectly contributes to getting relief from symptoms. Try to include some anti-inflammatory foods in her diet like fish & other seafood, fruits, vegetables, nuts and olive oil.\n\n5. Sleep Hygiene: The sensations disturbing her sleep could be due to restless legs syndrome or peripheral neuropathy, both of which are common in RA and fibromyalgia. These issues can also be addressed by a Rheumatologist or Neurologist.\n\nIt\n\n## Output (b):\n What medication does your mother currently take?\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}
