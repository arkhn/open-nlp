It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the infection is still present in your body, and it is recommended that you get examined by a doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms. Depending on the results of the examination, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or other medications to treat the infection. In the meantime, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help relieve your symptoms.

Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Have you experienced any of the following symptoms associated with cocaine use? Please select all that apply.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nUnfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on a variety of factors such as the amount of cocaine used, the frequency of use, and the individual's metabolism. Generally, cocaine can stay in the body for up to 72 hours, but it can remain in the system for up to a week or more. It is also important to note that cocaine can remain in sperm for up to 5 days after use. Therefore, it is best to wait at least a week before trying to conceive to ensure that the cocaine is out of your system.

I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Has there been any changes to the patient's condition?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is normal to have some residual brown discharge after your period. This is usually caused by old blood that has been in the uterus for a while and is now being expelled. It is not usually a cause for concern. However, if the discharge is accompanied by any other symptoms such as pain, itching, or a foul odor, then you should see your doctor for further evaluation. As for the bleeding during sex, this could be caused by a number of things such as an infection or a hormonal imbalance.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Thank you for your information. I will be sure to pass this on to the doctor. Is there anything else you would like to inform me of?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the hard lump is due to swelling from the wisdom tooth extraction. It is also possible that it is a hematoma, which is a collection of blood that has pooled in the area. It is important to follow up with your dentist to make sure that the lump is not something more serious. If it is due to swelling, it should go away with time.

Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did you do any research into your symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to give you a definitive answer without more information.

I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n It might be best to start with a general question.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nBacterial vaginosis is a common condition that can cause a fishy odor. It is usually treated with antibiotics, such as Metronidazole. However, if the infection is not treated, it can lead to more serious complications, such as infertility. The risk of infertility is low, but it is important to seek medical attention if you are concerned about your symptoms. Your doctor can help you determine the best course of treatment for your condition. Additionally, there are some lifestyle changes that can help reduce the risk of recurrent bacterial vaginosis, such as avoiding douching, wearing loose-fitting clothing, and avoiding scented soaps and products.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of related to this issue?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to diagnose your condition without a physical examination. However, it is possible that you are experiencing a form of facial nerve dysfunction, such as trigeminal neuralgia or Bell's palsy. It is also possible that you are experiencing a form of anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. I would recommend that you see a neurologist for a physical examination and further testing to determine the cause of your symptoms. Additionally, it may be beneficial to speak with a mental health professional to assess for any underlying anxiety or stress that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

She had been treated for TB (tuberculosis) of the abdomen as her ultrasound of abdomen finding was thicken bowel loop. In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition. But, her neuro problem of numbness in her legs and loss of sensation in legs still continues. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did you also see a dermatologist?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt sounds like your mother has been through a lot. It is difficult to give a definitive diagnosis without a full medical evaluation. However, it is possible that her symptoms are due to a combination of her TB treatment, her fall, and her arthritis. It is also possible that she has developed a peripheral neuropathy due to the TB treatment. I would recommend that she see a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment. The neurologist may recommend further testing such as an MRI or nerve conduction studies to help determine the cause of her symptoms. They may also recommend medications or physical therapy to help manage her symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I am taking Afrin spray for an hour and one pill of Sudafed. I developed a similar condition of cold and sinus infection before six months. I had severe clogging of ears. I was given Amoxicillin for five days and Prednisone 5 mg. My ENT doctor examined my ears and told me that there was no issue with the eardrum. He diagnosed it as eustachian tube issue. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What are your symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt sounds like you may have a chronic eustachian tube dysfunction. This is a condition where the eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the back of the nose, does not open and close properly. This can cause a buildup of fluid in the middle ear, leading to clogged ears and other symptoms. The treatment for this condition is usually a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. Your doctor may recommend a decongestant such as Sudafed to help reduce the swelling in the eustachian tube. They may also recommend a steroid such as prednisone to reduce inflammation. In addition, your doctor may suggest avoiding allergens and irritants that can worsen your symptoms. If these treatments do not help, your doctor may recommend a procedure to open the eustachian tube. This procedure is called a myringotomy.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

My mother is 50 years old. She complains of episodic, sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon. This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother. She has a history of menorrhagia and cycles have become more irregular now. Then, diagnostic D and C was performed last year, which was normal. She will not smoke or drink. She sleeps 4 to 6 hours daily and snores at night.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Does your mother have any other medical conditions?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nBased on the information provided, it is likely that your mother is suffering from a combination of conditions. It is possible that she is experiencing pain in her knees due to osteoarthritis, hip pain due to swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping due to a musculoskeletal disorder, and shoulder stiffness due to a rotator cuff injury. Additionally, her episodic sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon could be due to a tendon injury or tear.

Soon into using the drugs I developed headaches, dizziness, and nausea. I changed the type of PPI three times but the symptoms persisted. The symptoms included a feeling of pressure above my right ear and behind my right eye. Later, I came off the PPIs and after using over the counter headache painkillers for three days the severity of the headaches eased. But the feeling of pressure remains to this day on the right side of the face. I often feel heavy head or even light-headed with a slight dizziness, often as if I am hung over. The symptoms come and go, but are there every day for differing periods of time. And the constant is this feeling of slight pressure on the right side of my head above the ear and extending sometimes down to the cheek and behind the right eye.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n In the past, have you had any medical conditions or operations? Have you had any previous treatments?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the headaches and other symptoms you are experiencing are related to the use of PPIs. It is important to speak with your doctor about your symptoms and to discuss any potential side effects of the medications you have been taking. Your doctor may want to do some tests to rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. Additionally, your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes such as reducing stress, getting adequate sleep, and eating a healthy diet to help reduce your symptoms.

They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22. So everyone on my side of the family has thyroid issues. We were wondering if you could please give us some guidance. Looking to see if we need to eliminate thyroid as a possible cause of his symptoms or if it is worth further pursuit.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is there anything else the doctor should be aware of about your son's condition?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the low iodine and selenium levels could be causing thyroid issues, but it is difficult to say without further testing. It is also possible that the low iodine and selenium levels are a result of a dietary deficiency and not the cause of the symptoms. I would recommend speaking to your son's doctor about the possibility of further testing, such as a thyroid ultrasound or a thyroid hormone stimulation test, to determine if there is an underlying thyroid issue. If your son is too anxious to go to the doctor, you may want to consider seeking out a mental health professional to help him manage his anxiety.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

We visited a pediatrician who suggested a dermatologist consultation. I have attached images of the rashes and the prescription. We noticed that it increases in the evenings.

Tell me if this makes sense to you.Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg half pill twice a day, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq once daily, Losartan potassium 25 mg once daily, Warfarin sodium 5 mg once daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg, Digozin 25 mcg once daily and Furosemide 40 mg once daily.I need to know if these medications are fine to take all in one day and if so, I would like to split them into two times a day according to the reactions. I feel that so many medications doing the same thing is redundant and unnecessary and causing problems. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is your father currently taking any other medications?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nThis is a complex question and I would recommend that you speak to your father's cardiologist about his medication regimen. It is important to understand that each medication has a specific purpose and that the combination of medications is tailored to your father's individual needs. It is also important to understand that some medications may interact with each other, so it is important to discuss any changes to the medication regimen with the cardiologist. Additionally, it is important to understand that some medications may need to be taken at specific times of the day in order to be most effective. Therefore, it is important to discuss any changes to the medication regimen with the cardiologist before making any changes.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I have pain in the corner of my left eye for the past one year. I went to the doctor, and he gave me Sterdex. I used it and felt better. My pain went away. After a few months, I started to have pain, but it was not so severe as the first time. I wear glasses and lenses, and I am treating my eye allergy with Chibro Cadron 5 ml, and for dry eyes, I use Fluidabak after taking the lens. Whenever I do my yearly eye checkup, my eyesight gets worse because of the pain in the corner, and I am scared about my sight. I do not know whether I use an appropriate medicine to my eye. Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me the same medication. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n It looks like your doctor is not very clear about the diagnosis.

It is important to have a full eye examination to determine the cause of your pain and to ensure that you are using the appropriate medications. Your doctor may also recommend additional treatments such as lubricating eye drops, antibiotics, or steroid eye drops.

It showed a hianal hernia 2 cm. I am attaching photos. The doctor took biopsies, said no cancer. I have had breast cancer in the past. I am having pain in the chest when I swallow, and sternum today. Will that subside? Is it from the bleeding? And, can you recommend the best pill to take for this pain, taking Pantoprazole now? And what should I take for this problem, what should I eat? (Can you assure there is no cancer)?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n How serious is this?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nI am sorry to hear that you are having pain in your chest when you swallow and sternum. It is difficult to say whether the pain is from the bleeding or not without further information. I would recommend that you follow up with your doctor for further evaluation and treatment. As for the best pill to take for this pain, it would depend on the cause of the pain and your medical history.

I cannot assure you that there is no cancer without further testing, but I can recommend that you follow up with your doctor for further evaluation and treatment.

Even that my appearance is manly but in general my physical built is small compared to other men, my face, hands, legs are small also my voice is feminine.My testosterone level is good. My body is too hairy and I did a testosterone test everything was normal. I know there is a lot of studies that say that testosterone can lead to depression but actually at the age of 21 I was suffering from depression and I took testosterone for a month (to gain muscles), my mood was very good and it actually helped my depression. Also, my sexual life and erection are very good, I do masturbate once or twice every two days and I get an erection easily.Kindly help me with these questions:Will testosterone injections help me be more manly? What is the recommended dose that I have to take monthly? What are testosterone injections made from, are they made from an animal source? Will testosterone affects my personality? Do I have to take it for life? What if after some period I decided to stop will I loose what I gained?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Thank you for your answer. I will forward it to the doctor.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nTestosterone injections can help to increase muscle mass and strength, as well as improve libido and sexual performance. However, it is important to note that testosterone injections are not a \u201cquick fix\u201d and should only be used under the supervision of a qualified medical professional. The recommended dose of testosterone injections will depend on your individual needs and should be determined by your doctor. Testosterone injections are typically made from a synthetic form of the hormone, and not from an animal source. Testosterone injections can affect your personality, but this is usually only in cases of very high doses. If you decide to stop taking testosterone injections, you may experience some side effects, such as decreased muscle mass and strength, decreased libido, and decreased sexual performance. It is important to discuss any potential risks and benefits of testosterone injections with your doctor before starting treatment.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (a)"}

I have no fever or other symptoms. Should I be concerned? I had my atlas which was supposedly two degrees off by an atlas orthogonal chiropractor. I originally went in because of my knee and wrist pain then before I knew it, I was having my atlas adjusted by a machine. My last few days I have been miserable and feeling awful. Exhausted, my lymph nodes are so painful on the sides of my neck I have been in bed all day. I just feel this might be related but I do not know.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did the chiropractor give you any medication for the lymph nodes?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that the adjustment of your atlas could have caused the swelling and pain in your lymph nodes. However, it is also possible that this is unrelated and could be due to an infection or other medical condition. I would recommend that you see your doctor for an evaluation to determine the cause of your symptoms.

I have had a lot of digestive problems for about two years. I have been diagnosed with candida and dysbiosis but my regular doctor does not seem to know what is wrong with me. I have been very stressed and have suffered anxiety since I was about 16. I was not on any medications and started taking Cymbalta a few months ago.After about three to four days, I started to notice a bit of burning in my feet. I have since stopped taking the Cymbalta about a month ago. My feet seemed fine. Then seven days ago, I have started getting really bad pain in my feet and burning and tickling and pins and needle feelings. I am not diabetic or alcoholic. I have no idea what has brought this on or whether it can be reversed. I am so stressed out. I have to be on my feet for my job for about four and a half hours every morning. Can this be tested to see if the nerve cells are either dead or just damaged and can it be reversed? This feels like it is going to ruin my life. Please help.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Doctor, when do you want to see the patient for follow up?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to diagnose your condition without a physical examination and further testing. It is possible that the burning sensation in your feet is related to the stress and anxiety you have been experiencing. It is also possible that the burning sensation is related to the candida and dysbiosis. I recommend that you see a neurologist for further evaluation and testing. The neurologist may be able to determine the cause of the burning sensation and recommend a treatment plan. In the meantime, it is important to manage your stress and anxiety levels. You may want to consider talking to a therapist or counselor to help you manage your stress and anxiety.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

These small red pimples create a red area when seen from far away because they are very small and inflamed. It never disappears. My skin always feels stuck and not flexible and with a mildly itchy or burning sensation. No matter how much moisturizer I apply, it does not help. I am using Eucerin atopic control moisturizer and a gel cleanser with Hyaluronan. I even tried using Metronidazole and tea oil, but again it did not help. I have also tried to stop using anything on my face for some days, but it stayed the same. I am 24 years old now, and I never had acne tendencies when I was a teenager, and my skin always looked very smooth. My birth control pill is still the same as it was when I first started taking it, which wad around ten years ago. I do not use steroid creams nor fluoride toothpaste. How can I get rid of this? It was not there before a year. I am attaching a picture of my face. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Are you male or female?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to diagnose your condition without seeing you in person. However, it is possible that you are experiencing a skin condition called perioral dermatitis. This is a common skin condition that is characterized by red, inflamed bumps around the mouth, chin, forehead, and nose. It is often caused by the use of topical steroids, which can cause the skin to become irritated and inflamed. It is also possible that you are experiencing an allergic reaction to a product or ingredient that you are using on your skin. If you have not already done so, it is important to see a dermatologist for an evaluation and to discuss treatment options. The dermatologist may recommend a topical cream or ointment to help reduce inflammation and itching, as well as a change in your skin care routine.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I originally felt the pain after playing lots of baseballs (swinging a baseball bat many times). I have symptoms such as tightness, limited mobility or restricted range of motion, throbbing pain, and sometimes it gets so bad that it became hard for me to even walk or sit! I went to my athletic trainer a month ago, and she told me she thinks it is just an aggravated muscle spasm. So she told me to just give it some rest from the activity that hurt it. So I gave it about a month, in which it seemed there was no pain. But as soon as I tried to do the activity that hurt me in the first place, it went right back to hurting. It would be of great help for any assistance. What should I do now?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Please help! What should I do now?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt sounds like you may have a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back. It is important to rest the area and avoid activities that cause pain. You should also consider applying ice to the area for 15-20 minutes several times a day to reduce inflammation and pain. You may also want to take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or naproxen to help reduce pain and inflammation.

I have had a couple of speech therapy sessions but progress is glacial. I am still hoarse and in pain. I have been on 40 mg of Omeprazole for a month and Gaviscon Double Action for two weeks. I feel like the back of my throat is still swollen and I have pain in the corners of my throat. This only briefly eases when I really do some throat opening exercises. I cannot talk for very long without everything getting sore still. I have been like this since the beginning of the year since I had a chest infection and pneumonia. My mouth is now getting sore from all the Gaviscon tablets as the liquid irritates the corners of my throat. I really do not know what else I can do. I am having panic attacks and starting to feel like the only option is to take my life.

It just got worse. I play soccer and that and the sweat is what was irritating it. So I finally went to the doctor and they prescribed me SMZ, TMP DS. I took it for about a week until I realized I was having a lot of side effects and an allergic reaction especially around my mouth. At first I thought I was just breaking out. Then it was not like sores or blisters. I kept self-treating the rash around my mouth and stopped taking the antibiotics. For a couple days it was gone. I was happy. Then I was in the sun one day for soccer and it was just like another rash but worse. I stayed home from school, did not do anything because I just wanted to get it better. But now it looks really bad. I believe I have perioral dermatitis. It is red patches all around my mouth. It is really dry and scaly, also there are like white-heads around my mouth also but they are not whiteheads. I would try to moisturize it with coconut oil or tea tree oil but I think that is what made it worse.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Does the patient have any of the following symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt sounds like you may have developed a contact dermatitis from the antibiotics you were taking. Contact dermatitis is an allergic reaction to a substance that comes in contact with the skin. It is important to avoid the substance that is causing the reaction and to use a mild, fragrance-free moisturizer to help soothe the skin. You should also avoid any further use of coconut oil or tea tree oil, as these can be irritating to the skin. If the rash does not improve with these measures, you should see a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Could you also tell me by perhaps drawing on the shot what waves and shapes indicate problems?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n The report indicates that there is an infarction on the left ventricle and that a stress test was performed.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nThank you for your question. Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a detailed technical analysis of the treadmill stress test result without a more detailed medical history and a physical examination. The infarction seen on the treadmill stress test result could be indicative of a heart attack, but it could also be due to a machine error or other factors. It is important to discuss the results with your doctor to determine the cause and severity of the infarction. Generally, the presence of ST segment depression or elevation, T wave inversion, or Q waves on the ECG tracing can indicate a heart attack. However, it is important to note that the presence of these features does not necessarily mean that a heart attack has occurred.

Recently, I have elevated AST levels. There is no hepatitis or inflammatory diseases, alcohol, drug use, or fatty liver, or Addison\\s.Liver biopsy showed inflammation, but a resolving process likely attributed to a year long Lyme disease treatment with various pharmaceuticals but discontinued two years ago. Liver enzymes dropped to 50 ALT, but have recently elevated to 130 ALT.At this point, there is no known cause. I was told to continue to wait and see. I would like to take a different approach and determine if there is something my hepatologist is not seeing. The current medications are Lamictal and Gabapentin, Trazodone. I had abdominal CT, abdominal MRI, liver biopsy, ultrasounds, and a significant amount of blood work.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Are you the patient?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to provide a definitive answer without more information. However, it is possible that the elevated ALT and AST levels could be due to the medications you are taking. Lamictal and Gabapentin can cause elevated liver enzymes, and Trazodone can cause liver damage. It is also possible that the Lyme disease treatment could have caused some damage to the liver that is still affecting your liver enzymes. I would recommend speaking to your hepatologist about the possibility of changing your medications or reducing the dosage to see if that helps to reduce your liver enzymes. Additionally, it may be beneficial to have further tests done to determine if there is any underlying cause for the elevated liver enzymes.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

If I repeat the HIV test after six months what is the chance of staying negative? I am facing the problem like small bumps in the tongue, from the last two days a little bit of pain below ear region and it is a little swollen. Is it due to HIV?

I am 173 cm. My mother is 173 cm and father is 189 cm. I had a blood test to determine my HGH levels. The doctor asked me for a testosterone and GH test. The result came back a week later and it said that I had a low HGH level and a 21/42 level testosterone. Is this normal for an 18 year old male? I was devastated that my growth plates were closed, because I also had an x-ray of left hand. My doctor asked me whether I am sexually active. I answered him no. But, I got a doubt regarding erectile dysfunction. Am I suffering from erectile dysfunction? Should I be worried? Is my testosterone too low? How can I increase testosterone? I had torsion three years back and nothing back happened. But, this could be a factor. Another factor may be that I used to hold my mobile phone in my pocket all the time.I am a sprint athlete and have defined leg muscles, but this could be due to my short stature. I have gone for another blood test for GH, just as a follow up and that time I was advised to fast for 14 hours. But, I did not fast during my first blood test. Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What is your age?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to say whether or not your testosterone levels are too low without knowing more about your medical history and other factors. However, it is possible that your low HGH levels could be contributing to your short stature. It is also possible that your erectile dysfunction could be related to your low testosterone levels, but it is difficult to say without more information. If you are concerned about your testosterone levels, it would be best to speak to your doctor about it. They may be able to recommend lifestyle changes or medications that can help to increase your testosterone levels.

I think she also has rheumatoid arthritis. For the past five years, she was managing the pain with anti-inflammatory medicine, Lyrica, Mythycobal, Voltaren injections, herbal creams, etc. You can see the veins in her hands popping out. I also realized that the pain has got worse now.For about 12 months the doctor put her only on Prednisolone 5 mg/day and painkiller when necessary. She was fine till last month but the pain increased in her hands now. In the daytime she is fine and the pain starts mildly in the evening. When she lies down in the bed she gets electrical tingling in her legs by which her sleep gets disturbed. She has undergone several tests last week and I attached them for your reference. She did not consult a rheumatologist yet. What medication can I give to reduce the inflammation and cure her? Her ESR, CPR, and ANA are quite high. The pain in her hands and the tingling in her legs at night are agonizing her life. Kindly provide your expert advice.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What medication does your mother currently take?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your mother's condition. It sounds like she is suffering from both fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. The best course of action would be to consult a rheumatologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The tests you have provided suggest that she has an inflammatory condition, which could be causing the pain and tingling in her legs. The rheumatologist may recommend medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to reduce inflammation and pain. They may also suggest lifestyle changes such as exercise, physical therapy, and stress management to help manage her symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I am currently applying Benzoyl peroxide gel on my acne. It only reduces the inflammation but bumps are not reducing. I also have pigmentation caused by acne before. I only get acne on my cheeks. What may be the reason? I usually get cyst acne bumps on my cheeks. If acne clears, then it comes again. I have red pigmentation caused by acne. Can you recommend a product for acne and after acne has cleared, can you suggest a product for pigmentation? Can you recommend a product for controlling further breakouts? Also, I wanted to know which sunscreen and moisturizer to use?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Why did you get Pimple?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to recommend a product without knowing your skin type and other factors. However, I would recommend using a gentle cleanser and a non-comedogenic moisturizer. You can also use a topical retinoid such as tretinoin or adapalene to help reduce the inflammation and prevent further breakouts. For pigmentation, you can use a product containing hydroquinone or kojic acid. For sunscreen, you should use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I am currently getting labs done for hepatitis B Surf Ab Quant, HBsAg screen, hepatitis B virus profile, and panel. I am getting conflicting information on websites and from healthcare professionals that hepatitis B does not ever leave the body but I also read that 98 % of the people who get it cleared the disease from the body. My question is what is the real answer, can I beat the virus and remove it from my body completely leaving only anti-bodies?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Can I get your weight and height with shoes on?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nThe answer to your question is that it is possible to clear the virus from the body, but it is not common. The majority of people who are infected with hepatitis B will remain infected for life. However, some people are able to clear the virus from their body, usually within 6 months of infection. This is known as spontaneous clearance. If you have tested positive for the hepatitis B core antibody, it is likely that you have been infected with the virus at some point in your life, but it is possible that you have cleared it. To determine if you have cleared the virus, you will need to have additional tests done, such as the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

After the first time, there was a lot of pain, but had a regular whitish discharge. Second time, I started having this brownish or yellowish discharge and I have taken the photo of the discharge. I am not sure what it is? Neither of us have STDs. I am quite scared of being pregnant. I do not remember when I had my last period. Is this discharge normal? Please help me.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is it normal for you to have brownish or yellowish discharge?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to determine what the discharge is without seeing it in person. It is possible that it could be a sign of an infection, so it is important to see a doctor for an evaluation. It is also possible that the discharge could be related to pregnancy, so it is important to take a pregnancy test to rule out this possibility.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

MRI before surgery and post-surgery are attached. Biopsy report is also attached. So, kindly help me to understand the biopsy report. Current medications are Encorate Chrono 500 mg twice daily, Thyronorm 50 mg. Current problems are weight loss, severe hair fall, less appetite, weakness, not able to eat or smell non-veg items, no hunger.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What are your symptoms?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nThe biopsy report indicates that your sister has a tumor in her brain. The tumor is a low-grade glioma, which is a type of brain tumor that is usually slow-growing and non-cancerous. The report also indicates that the tumor is located in the left frontal lobe of the brain. The MRI images show that the tumor is causing some swelling in the brain, which is likely causing the symptoms your sister is experiencing. Treatment for this type of tumor typically involves surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, followed by radiation and/or chemotherapy. Your sister's doctor will be able to provide more information about the treatment plan. In the meantime, it is important that she continue to take her medications as prescribed and follow her doctor's instructions for managing her symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

And it has been about 4 1/2 weeks since my last menstrual period. Unfortunately with labor day being this weekend I have been unable to see my regular OBGYN. But I did go to the ER to confirm the pregnancy 2 days ago. So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth. I have been having bad panic attacks over this and cannot seem to relax as the complications of these medicines are always on my mind. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Can you give me a reason for the Percocet?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed and scared right now. It is important to remember that you are not alone and that there are resources available to help you. It is also important to remember that you are not a terrible mother before you even give birth. You are doing the best you can to make sure your baby is safe and healthy.\n\nIt is important to talk to your doctor about your concerns and to discuss the risks and benefits of continuing to take the medications you are currently taking. Your doctor can help you decide if it is safe to continue taking the medications or if you need to switch to a different medication. Your doctor can also provide you with information about the potential risks and complications associated with taking these medications during pregnancy. Additionally, your doctor can provide you with resources to help you manage your anxiety and back pain during pregnancy.\n\nIt is also important to remember that you are not alone and that there are resources available to help you. You can reach out to your local pregnancy center or your doctor for support and resources. Additionally, there are online support groups and forums that can provide you with additional support and information.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that you are not a terrible mother before you even give birth. You are doing the best you can to make sure your baby is safe and healthy.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Sadly, I declined rapidly and lost all my hypotheaner and some of my lumbericals in a matter of six weeks. I was operated on exactly 14 weeks ago where I had a decompression of the ulnar nerve and an anterior interosseous nerve transfer to the motor component of the ulnar nerve so that the nerve axons would reach my hand quicker. I still have no improvement and I wanted to ask if it is possible to transfer muscle to fill in the hand? And will this protect my nerves in the hand? Would it be too soon to be considering this operation?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n So you have heard from your doctor that the nerves did not recover. Now, you're considering a new surgery, but you have some concerns about it.

It is not typically done to protect nerves in the hand. It is too soon to be considering this operation at this time. You should wait until you have seen some improvement in your hand function before considering this type of surgery.

For the past five months, I am undergoing this treatment. Prior to chemotherapy, I was taking ayurvedic medicine for the same problem. I took the medicine for about eight months, but it did not have any benefit. At that time, I was not aware of the exact problem. I was advised to remove the breast completely, but by the god\\s grace, I was referred to a doctor in oncology. The surgery has not been performed. They started with chemotherapy. Till now, I have completed five cycles. Still, how many cycles are needed for me? Will rest be given to me after the cycles? I am unable to eat, swallow or drink. I have lost my appetite. I have vomiting. Motions are happening from when I start eating my regular diet. I am feeling very depressed and demotivated. I have lost hope from the past five months. My left breast is healing and dressing is done over it. The skin is removed over a part. My breast looks flat as if it is removed. There is itching over the breast. Are there any chances for the regrowth of my breast? If yes, how many months will it take? If it does not regrow, what is the alternative for that?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Doctor, what is the complaint?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to answer your questions without knowing more about your specific situation. The number of chemotherapy cycles you need will depend on the type of cancer you have, the stage of the cancer, and how your body responds to the treatment. Your doctor will be able to provide you with more information about the number of cycles you need. Rest periods between cycles are usually recommended to allow your body to recover from the treatment.\n\nRegarding your other symptoms, it is important to speak to your doctor about them. Loss of appetite, vomiting, and difficulty swallowing can all be side effects of chemotherapy. Your doctor may be able to provide you with medications to help manage these symptoms.\n\nIt is also important to speak to your doctor about the regrowth of your breast. Depending on the type of cancer you have, there may be treatments available to help regrow your breast. However, it is important to speak to your doctor about the risks and benefits of these treatments.\n\nFinally, it is important to take care of your mental health during this difficult time. It is normal to feel depressed and demotivated, and it is important to seek help if you are feeling overwhelmed. Your doctor may be able to refer you to a mental health professional who can provide you with support.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

My mother had exactly the same disorder like myself. She was diagnosed with an under active thyroid and autoimmune thyroid issue. On taking medication to sort her levels she has been free from the mental health problems.I recently started getting the issue again and took a thyroid function blood test. All levels were within range but my FT3 was slightly elevated at 8.97 pmol /L. I would love an expert opinion on if periodic FT3 level increases could be causing the anxiety, depression, and OCD issues. I am currently on Sertraline 150 mg. Coupled with my mother's exact issue, and cure, I am not sure what these results could mean? What should my next step be and could this elevated FT3 cause my anxiety to start?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Before we move on, I have a few questions to ask about your mother's condition.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is possible that an elevated FT3 level could be causing your anxiety, depression, and OCD issues. However, it is important to note that there are many other factors that can contribute to these issues, such as lifestyle, diet, and other medical conditions. It is also important to note that Sertraline can also cause anxiety and depression in some people. Therefore, it is important to discuss your symptoms with your doctor to determine the best course of action. Your doctor may recommend further testing to determine the cause of your symptoms, or they may recommend adjusting your medication or lifestyle to help manage your symptoms.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I removed the allergen from my diet and was prescribed Elidel to help clear the rash. However, I experienced over the course of two to three days, white patches which look as there is absolutely no pigment present in these areas. Will hypopigmentation from the use of Elidel fade? I was prescribed Elidel for the first time for a rash on my face. I am pale, but these are extremely white patches reminiscent of acne scars (but being completely flat). Is this likely to be permanent? Will it likely fade? If it may fade, how long would this likely take? What are my potential treatment options? No major injury to the sites was noticed aside from the generalized rash that was being treated.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n There is something else we need to know about your condition.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nHypopigmentation from the use of Elidel is usually temporary and should fade over time. It is possible that the white patches you are experiencing are due to the Elidel, but it is also possible that they are due to the rash itself. If the patches are due to the Elidel, they should fade over the course of several weeks to months. If the patches are due to the rash, they may take longer to fade.\n\nIf the patches do not fade over time, you may want to consider other treatment options such as laser treatments or topical creams.

Also, I had regular neuro examination and normal MRI of the head and cervical spine.After a few months, I stopped B12 levels up then a few months after the same symptoms again and B12 low again. Started back on B12 symptoms went away in a couple of months. Last month it started signs yet, but still, on B12 it is very high 1270 so symptoms not due to that. Had another head MRI was normal.

I do not have any structural or plumbing heart issues. I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row. The EP I saw in the hospital prescribed me Flecainide 50 mg, twice daily. I saw another EP, who was a much older guy, as a second opinion. He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation. I do not agree with him on the ablation due to recent medical studies on WPW and how ablation is recommended even for asymptomatic patients, especially athletes.My question is regarding Flecainide. I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW. Do you think Flecainide at this dosage is safe and reasonable for the next two weeks, until my ablation?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n I see. So, you have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and you are waiting for an ablation in 17 days. Is that correct?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nFlecainide is generally considered safe for short-term use in asymptomatic WPW patients, and it is often used to help control the heart rate prior to an ablation. However, it is important to discuss the risks and benefits of this medication with your doctor, as there is a risk of developing a dangerous rhythm with its use. It is also important to note that the risk of developing a dangerous rhythm is higher in athletes, so it is important to be monitored closely while taking this medication. Ultimately, it is up to you and your doctor to decide if the benefits of taking Flecainide outweigh the risks.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Her bite is fine but her teeth are not properly aligned and she does not have bone on her left side. Her orthodontist referred her to a maxillofacial surgeon who says she needs her upper jaw broken and rotated clockwise and slightly up to compensate for the lack of bone and her bottom jaw also has to be broken and rotated clockwise. It would all then be held by plates and screws. My biggest concern is that she is a beautiful girl and he says that her face will not change at all. Is that true with this kind of procedure?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n The doctor will know best, but these questions may help them understand your concerns.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to answer this question without seeing your daughter and her specific situation. Generally speaking, the goal of maxillofacial surgery is to improve the alignment of the teeth and jaw without significantly changing the appearance of the face. However, it is possible that there may be some subtle changes in the shape of the face after the surgery. It is important to discuss your concerns with the maxillofacial surgeon and to make sure that you are comfortable with the proposed treatment plan.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

Yesterday, doctors have checked my blood. I am visiting a hospital frequently as I have iron deficiency anemia. The thing I am scared about is, my doctor asked me why my ferritin has not increased (just the opposite, it has decreased from 5.79 to 5.77) after three months of taking iron supplements. My other iron levels are at 39 which has increased considering those references. But, that was probably because I did not use the medicine correctly, I was only taking 5 mg a day. Another thing I am worried about is, my lymphocytes kind of got increased in my blood: (52.8) - the reference is 19.4 to 44.9, and the other one is 3.57. My neutrophils kind of decreased too (36.9) and the reference was between 41.0 to 73.0.In the last week, I had a viral infection as both my parents were sick. Is it why my levels got high? My WBC is 6.77 and RBC is 4.52. My hemoglobin is also increasing actually, last time I checked, it was 11.0 and now it is 11.2. Still low, but it was good to see that it was increasing. My thrombocyte levels got higher again, unfortunately. The first time I was told that I was anemic, my thrombocyte levels were on 485, then in my second blood test (after using iron supplements correctly it decreased to 380. And yesterday, when I checked, it increased to 435 (reference is 156 to 373).I was also told that I have an infection in my urinary system and he gave me antibiotics. Honestly, I have been always getting suspected about it since my anemia has started. Should I be worried about my condition or is it normal?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Thank you for your medical history. Your doctor will review it to diagnose the problem.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is normal for your ferritin levels to fluctuate, especially when you are taking iron supplements.

It is important to make sure that you are taking your iron supplements correctly and that you are following your doctor's instructions.

While I am sleeping, I get up just once to urinate, sometimes not at all. Do you think I have diabetes? I got my blood sugar checked, and it came out as perfectly normal (91, normal range is 80-100 for fasting). I think it is highly unlikely I am going to get diabetes in less than two years after the last checkup, but I wanted to confirm since my family has a history of this illness, and that is scaring me a bit. I am a 28-year-old male with asthma and acid reflux.I am currently on Montelukast, Advair and Omeprazole.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Can you tell me what you are taking the medication for?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is unlikely that you have diabetes based on your blood sugar levels.

Please see the attached picture. Involuntary frowning causes lines to run through the scar, can this be causing problems? Is it worth taping my forehead, so I cannot make frown lines? Is it worth getting a botox to stop frowning till I am healed? I am using a vitamin C and silicone scar cream to attempt better removal of hyperpigmentation. Is this a problem? I cannot tell if it is this or the creasing making it worse. I am starting to get very depressed about this scar revision. It was bad enough getting mugged and getting this wound. Now it is not healing even after a scar revision surgery. Thanks.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Is the patient male or female?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to say without seeing the scar in person, but it is possible that the creasing of your forehead is causing the scar to worsen. It is worth trying to tape your forehead to see if that helps. Botox may also be an option to help reduce the creasing, but it is important to discuss this with your doctor first. The use of a vitamin C and silicone scar cream may help with the hyperpigmentation, but it is important to follow the instructions of your doctor and use the cream as directed. It is also important to be patient with the healing process, as it can take several months for a scar to fully heal.

When after eating or having something hot or cold, I feel sensitive and after that, I get pain for some time but the pain goes away automatically. I have gone to one of the dentists and she suggested me to get a root canal treatment done but I feel that the pulp or tissue of that tooth is not yet damaged and can be recovered without doing a root canal. I am attaching a picture of my tooth.

At that time, my vision in the right eye was hand movements only and I was diagnosed with a macular injury. Three months later, my vision slowly improved to 6/36. However, my right eye started to deviate (exotropia) and I started experiencing diplopia. My main problem is diplopia. I have used prisms, but of no use. When I try to focus on an image, I have severe diplopia. The diplopia disappears when I try to correct the squint. At present, I am doing higher studies and the diplopia is really bothering me. Will doing a squint surgery be of any use? Is there anything that I can try?\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Please answer questions based on your medical training and experience.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to answer your question without a full eye examination. However, it is possible that a squint surgery may be of some benefit in reducing your diplopia. It is important to have a full eye examination to determine the cause of your diplopia and to determine if a squint surgery is the best option for you. Additionally, there are other treatments that may be beneficial, such as vision therapy, prism glasses, and botulinum toxin injections. I would recommend that you see an ophthalmologist for a full eye examination and to discuss the best treatment options for you.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I also have an upper molar that is broken decayed and has been like this for years. The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw. The dentist had said the next thing she could give me was Clindamycin, but I have a fear of the side effects of that medicine. I already have heart problems and mild stomach issues. I have read that Clindamycin can cause severe gastrointestinal problems and arrhythmias. She also suggested Zithromax, but I have had heart palpitations while on that medication as well. I am having the teeth removed by an oral surgeon in two weeks, but am afraid of dying from infection before then. What are my options? What is the best course of action? Are there other antibiotics for this? Am I dying from the infection already? Any of your advice or help is appreciated. My other possibly relevant health history is as follows: I have high blood pressure, tachycardia, high cholesterol and mild PVC\\s. I had a MRSA infection in my arm 10 years ago. I have many strep throat infections every year and frequent sinus issues. Also, I would like to mention that when I took smoothed Cephalexin capsule with a sip of water, I got a random salty taste in my mouth.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Did the dentist say anything about the pain level in your jaw?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is important to understand that the infection in your wisdom tooth and decayed molar can spread to other parts of your body, including your heart and brain. Therefore, it is important to take the necessary steps to prevent this from happening. The best course of action is to have the teeth removed by an oral surgeon as soon as possible. In the meantime, it is important to continue taking the Cephalexin as prescribed by your dentist. If the infection does not improve with the Cephalexin, then your dentist may consider prescribing a different antibiotic, such as Clindamycin or Zithromax. However, it is important to discuss the potential side effects of these medications with your dentist before taking them. Additionally, it is important to monitor your symptoms closely and seek medical attention if they worsen.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

I had visited a dentist for a check-up. He did X-ray of my teeth and told me that food stuck between molar teeth and wisdom teeth is causing pain. So he advised me to remove wisdom teeth and filling process. But I am scared that upper teeth have a connection with brain and eyes. So, the process of teeth removal can harm my eyes and brain.

There are no signs of it from the last one year. However, she has these bulging eyes all the time, but she can perfectly see everything with her spectacles. I do not really know what happened to her the other day. She was watching her favorite TV show and all of sudden, her right eye popped out of her eye socket and she started shouting. It was such a scary and frightening situation where I and my dad did not know what to do and out of nowhere, my dad suddenly pushed her eye with a little pressure and the eye was back in its position as usual. My mom experienced severe pain after this incident when she was rushed to an Ophthalmologist. The doctor had no clue about the reason for her eye pop out. However, I advised her to go through a few medical tests and the results are yet to come. Meantime, I just want to understand why this happened to her and will this happen regularly and what is the treatment needed to prevent this from happening again. I just do not want to think of any situation where she is alone in the home and the same happens to her. I just want her to be completely cured from this one. Please help me with my query.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n What would you like to ask the doctor?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to say why your mother's eye popped out of her eye socket without knowing the results of her medical tests.

This can be caused by a variety of conditions, including thyroid disease, Graves' disease, tumors, or inflammation of the eye socket. It is important that your mother follow up with her doctor to determine the cause of her eye popping out and to receive the appropriate treatment. Treatment may include medications, surgery, or lifestyle changes.

I am worried about any possible infection that could happen. I did a p24 antigen test. The results are p24 antigen on fourth day-0.125, sixth day-0.254, ninth day-0.271, twelfth day-0.274, fifteenth day-0.396, nineteenth day-0.540.I am upset about the increase in count. Please advise. I have done PCR RNA after 15 days for HIV 1, and it is not of detected status and HIV 2 ELISA on the nineteenth day which was also nonreactive. Kindly advise.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Anything else you want to tell us about?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is good that you have done the tests and that the results are negative.

One year ago, I was suffering from a hard stool that was difficult to pass. I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days. During this time, I was always sleepy. I took leave from work and was always tired and fatigued. Earlier this month, I went to another GI specialist who did a sigmoidoscopy and said that it is SRUS. He said that I should not finger evacuate the stools and gave me liquid paraffin and LoX cream. Now, my current situation is that it has been three days and I am very constipated and fatigued. The pain has subsided a little. However, I am not passing stools as I used to before. After I drink water or eat something, I get a vomiting sensation. I get anxiety and panic attacks as I am scared about my condition and do not know which doctor I should consult and what I should do. Is this condition serious and life-long? Will I ever be cured? Please advise on the correct medications (allopathy or ayurveda), lifestyle changes and other things to take care.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Thank you for the details. The doctor will speak with you after the consultation.\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is difficult to give a definitive answer without a full medical evaluation. However, it is important to note that anal fissures, internal hemorrhoids, SRUS, and constipation can all be managed with lifestyle changes and medications. It is important to follow the advice of your doctor and take the medications prescribed. Additionally, lifestyle changes such as increasing fiber intake, drinking plenty of fluids, and exercising regularly can help to reduce symptoms and improve overall health. Additionally, it is important to reduce stress and anxiety as this can worsen symptoms. If symptoms persist, it is important to seek medical advice from a qualified healthcare professional.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}

If you are worried about pregnancy, you can take a pregnancy test two weeks after the unprotected sex. If the test is negative, then you are likely not pregnant.

On the 2nd, my girlfriend started her period. It is now the 16th. So, I believe she is in her ovulation phase. Since her period stopped, she has begun, for the very first time, taking the combined contraceptive pill consistently at 8 AM every morning. She took the pill yesterday morning. Last night, on the 15th of March, we had unprotected sex (we thought one night without condoms would be fine). However, this morning she was in a rush and forgot to take her pill for today. It is 2:16 PM now and I have a few urgent questions:Should she take the morning after pill?How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today?Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk?Should we be worried?Thank you.\n\nAssistant:\n\n## Output (a):\n Was your girlfriend using the pill before?\n\n## Output (b):\n\nIt is recommended that your girlfriend take the morning after pill as soon as possible. The effectiveness of the morning after pill is highest when taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex. The pills she has taken previously will lower the risk of pregnancy, but not completely eliminate it. The risk of pregnancy is highest during the time of ovulation, so there is a risk of pregnancy in this case. The period of time between the missed pill and the time she takes the morning after pill is important, as the effectiveness of the morning after pill decreases the longer it is delayed. It is recommended that she take today's pill today, even if she is taking the morning after pill. Other things you can do to minimize the risk of pregnancy include using condoms for future sexual encounters and discussing other forms of contraception with your doctor. You should be worried, but taking the morning after pill and other precautions can help reduce the risk.\n\n## Which is the better choice, Output (a) or Output (b), or is it a Tie?\n", "response": "Output (b)"}
